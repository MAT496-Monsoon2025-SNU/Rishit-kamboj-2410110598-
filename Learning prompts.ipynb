    "SNUCONtext = \"\"\"In the rat race we call life, we as students have been blessed to be part of a prestigious institution like Shiv Nadar Institute of Eminence. Being part of such a renowned institution comes with its perks in terms of the quality of education and the availability of resources we as students have at our disposal. However, despite these perks, we face several challenges, including the course enrollment process. The enrollment process has been built meticulously by the administration based on past experience and has even made certain adaptations this time around to help alleviate some of the stress that comes with this process; however, some flaws remain.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a second year student at SNU, this isn’t the first time I have dealt with the enrollment process, and I know this won’t be the last, but this is the first time a lot of us have dealt with the full brunt of the problems within the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the admin’s best efforts to make the system better, major flaws remain. These flaws, in broad strokes, can be explained in a few key facts: lack of CCC options, lack of CCC seats, lack of UWE options, lack of UWE seats, lack of ability to pick either one because of clashing timings, and various technical issues. This lack of choice means that the students are forced to pick up online Swayam courses to meet academic requirements. The root issue that presents itself here is the overall low teaching staff to student ratio due to constant increase in student population every year. The problem cannot be blamed on the professors alone; the infrastructure is also considerably lacking, as professors are also limited in the number of students they can accommodate because the size of the classrooms act as a limiting factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are grievances that I’ve heard from parents and students regarding these issues:-\n",
    "\n",
    "“1685 seats for 2389 students who need to take CCCs. So over 700 students can’t access courses that they need to take to get a degree”\n",
    "“I believe the college should gauge how much there is a demand for each course and then have seats accordingly”\n",
    "“I had added one UWE and 2 CCC’s to my course wish list just for backu[p]. The site stopped responding [and I] had to reload, then tried enrolling showed a red box saying enrollment couldn’t be completed, site stopped responding […] and [I] ended up getting no course even though I was all prepared for this registration from 2:30 [pm].”\n",
    "“ why are students being forced to give up quality of education by taking an online course”\n",
    "“ We’re paying for this total number of credits in these 4 yrs [years] however we’re needed to do and then again to complete those credits that we already paid for we’re having to take swayam courses. Like if you’re going to do this then just don’t take 6K per credit for tuition[.] You’re not teaching us for those credits anyways.” (The ₹6,000 per credit for tuition, as claimed by the student here, refers to the tuition system for the summer semester. However, for the monsoon and spring semesters, the cost per credit varies depending on the degree the student is pursuing, as fees differ for each degree, and the maximum number of credits a student can take is 25 per semester, regardless of the degree chosen. Certain degrees have fees higher than ₹6,000 per credit, while others may be lower.)\n",
    "“I just have an issue with the lack I of CCCs and a further lack of seats in the CCCs offered”\n",
    "“ I wanted the news writing CCC and the prof opened more seats at 3[pm] but because enrollment opened 10 mins late by the time we could enrol seats were gone and when I tried adding others[other CCC’s] same[issue happened].”\n",
    "“ There’s no UWEs most of us can take despite being in third year, and most of us don’t even have a single major elective. They literally don’t have enough seats to make sure all of us get an elective at all, let alone something that interests us” (third year B.Tech CSE major)\n",
    "“ the untold truth: You can’t do a minor” “[it is] indeed a marketing strategy”\n",
    "“Yes [I] did face similar issues to this thing of not getting enrolled in [a] single ccc’s but also that how the social sciences and humanities department have really very less CCCs based on their area of interest and themes like a to of them is either science or English. This is something I really think should be given a thought about.”\n",
    "“ If we were to take admission after knowing what we know now I think more than 50% of us would not take admission in SNU. I am looking to move my kid to another university if there’s a lateral entry option.”\n",
    "In response to the freshers raising concerns about the enrollment process, a senior said, “if you’re doing this change you need to start from the[your] year itself and then wait till the batches who were ****ed over previously pass.” While reflective of the frustrations students have endured over time, this sentiment is disheartening and not one that should be held by students of such a forward thinking, student centric, and esteemed institution.\n",
    "\n",
    "We, as students, should realise that the issue isn’t the fact that the seniors are screwing us over, it is very clearly a problem of the system. A system that needs to be changed because it leads to students feeling disregarded and frustrated. Most students don’t get the courses they want. They end up having to beg the professor to enroll them into the class by getting special permission to increase class size, and even then, they may not get the course as timetable issues continue to rise as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second year batch of B.Tech Mechanical Engineering continue to fight a losing battle as they email the admin about timetable changes to accommodate UWEs they wish to pursue (in demand by 40+ students in a batch of 75); however it has led to no real solutions. The final word from the admin is an email stating that the final timetable has been sent and no changes can be made.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, students also don’t get seats for their major electives. Around half the students in the third year batch of B. Tech CSE are left without a major elective because of a lack of seats in the courses. I was informed that this has become common practice at this point and the seniors told them to finish their CCC requirements this year so that they can focus on the major electives in their fourth year.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system also pits the students against each other by creating a situation where each batch gets to pick their courses one at a time, with the 4th years going first, the third years going second and so on. This systematically creates a divide between the students of different batches, as they feel like they aren’t treated fairly. It is understood that the system is in this state because the fourth year students need to be able to complete their degrees and their minors so they get the priority choices; however many fourth years aren’t satisfied with the system either. They face issues due to the timetables, UWEs with minimal seats, and even apparent refusal in many cases from the college to give a credit extension to students in order for them to meet their degree requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "All this considered, the system is also broken from a technical standpoint. Constant server crashes, pages hanging, and people getting unenrolled from courses have become the norm to the point where the seniors were surprised that their course registration went smoothly due to changes made by the admin this year. This is a significant step in the right direction, but problems still plagued the second-year students due to their larger batch size.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Swayam system, in its current form, presents its own challenges as well. Many parents and students have expressed their disheartenment with the system, where they feel like they are being forced into opting for an online course despite having paid full tuition fees with the expectation of having offline classes taught by highly qualified professors at the institution. Swayam was meant as a supplementary platform to allow students to explore subjects that the college could not offer. However, it has evolved into something that cannot be expressed as anything but a crutch for the temporary shortfall in the college’s availability of courses, faculty, and seats in said courses. Although we sincerely appreciate the Swayam system for letting students experience courses beyond what our prestigious university can provide, the current system has to be reevaluated to uphold the incredibly high academic standards that the institution holds dear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, in a discussion in a parents’ group a parent speculates, “They[Their] sole focus is external optic to attack new students and funds”. This One message alone should show the level of frustration the parents are feeling on the behalf of their wards, even after only one year at this university. This isn’t due to a lack of belief in the university, but this frustration has been piling up in the minds of the parents due to the practical challenges that students face. As students and parents, we know that the university has the foundation to be a beacon of academic excellence, which is why we chose to be here. However, these challenges make it hard to leave that thought unwavering in the minds of parents and students.\n",
    "\n",
    "All this to say, a flawed system like this needs to be amended urgently so that we, the students of such a prestigious institution, can fully spread our wings and make the most of the world-class resources this university so generously provides.\n",

      "St. Pucelle never looked more beautiful than it did on the day that I\n",
      "took that walk with Charlie Sandilands. The summer glories, yet unfaded,\n",
      "had been overtaken by those of autumn, and the rich clusters of purple\n",
      "grapes that hung upon the walls of my guardian’s house made a brilliant\n",
      "contrast to the scarlet and white and rose-coloured geraniums that still\n",
      "bloomed luxuriantly on the window-sills. The purple heather reigned\n",
      "alone upon the hill-side, but ferns of various sorts were arching their\n",
      "graceful fronds above it, and the merry brown hares were leaping amongst\n",
      "the brushwood and filling the place with life. As I led Charlie up the\n",
      "hill (for I would not let Tessie’s silly remark deter me from showing\n",
      "him the glorious expanse of scenery to be gained from the summit) I\n",
      "pointed out the beauties of the country to him with so much interest as\n",
      "to excite the remark that I appeared entirely to have forgotten poor old\n",
      "Norwood in my new love for St. Pucelle.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was exactly the sort of thing I had hoped Charlie would say to me,\n",
      "for I had had two reasons in inviting him to a confidential interview:\n",
      "one was to ask his advice about writing to Mr. Warrington; the other to\n",
      "find out if he intended to be sensible during his stay in our\n",
      "neighbourhood, and permit me to enjoy his company without being annoyed\n",
      "by his sentimentality. So I answered briskly:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I never cared for Norwood itself, you know, Charlie, and you would\n",
      "scarcely expect me to get up an enthusiastic admiration for a suburb of\n",
      "London, composed of bricks and mortar and stunted trees. Its\n",
      "recollections are sacred to me, because my dear mother lies there, but\n",
      "that is all.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I was sure that coming abroad would give you a distaste for all the old\n",
      "things,’ he said, in a desponding manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Don’t talk rubbish, Charlie! You were sure of no such thing! If you ask\n",
      "me if I was happy at Norwood, I answer “_yes_” most fervently. If you\n",
      "ask me if I liked the place as a residence, I answer, as fervently,\n",
      "“_no_.” I should have been happy with my mother in St. Giles’s; but I\n",
      "should not have admired the locality.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Ah well! Let us return to St. Pucelle,’ he said, with a sigh.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No! I refuse to return to St. Pucelle until I have spoken a few words\n",
      "to you. Do you mean to enjoy your holiday here, Charlie, and to let me\n",
      "enjoy it, or not?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I don’t understand what you’re driving at.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I’m driving at you, or rather at that receptacle for nonsense you call\n",
      "your brain. Now you know I am very fond of you, Charlie, and have been\n",
      "for years. You are so associated with my darling mother, that you seem\n",
      "like a link with the past to me; and I should like to treat you like a\n",
      "younger brother, and to feel that you looked upon me as a sister. But\n",
      "that can never be whilst you attempt to stuff any of your sentiment down\n",
      "my throat.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Really, Hilda——’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Really, Charlie, please to hear me out first, and have your say\n",
      "afterwards. If I thought that what you told me at Norwood proceeded from\n",
      "a feeling such as men conceive in their maturity, and preserve for their\n",
      "whole lives, I should not dare broach the subject to you again. But I am\n",
      "sure it did not.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You imagine, in fact, that I am such a _boy_,’ with a withering accent\n",
      "on the word, ‘that I am incapable of a lasting passion.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Just so! That is just what I do think; at least, I am sure the fancy\n",
      "you took for me was born entirely of association and compassion.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I confess I do not follow you.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh yes, you do! There are several kinds of love, Charlie, but only one\n",
      "is the right one with which to enter upon a partnership for life. You\n",
      "had known me for so long: you had become so _used_ to me, in fact, that\n",
      "when you thought of our separation, and under such melancholy\n",
      "circumstances, the pain seemed too hard to bear, and your mind flew to\n",
      "the only means by which you could have kept me with you. I have often\n",
      "and often thought of it since, and I am sure I am right. It was very\n",
      "good and sweet and true of you, Charlie, and I love you the better for\n",
      "it, but you should thank God I was more clear-sighted than yourself, for\n",
      "we should have been a very miserable couple.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Do you think so, Hilda?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I am _sure_ of it! My dear boy, you are just at that age when men think\n",
      "they can live happily with any woman who is young and passably\n",
      "good-tempered and passably good-looking. But the daily companionship of\n",
      "a married life is a terrible crucible through which to pass the\n",
      "affections, and only the true ore will bear the test of it.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I suppose you have found the “true ore” in St. Pucelle,’ he grumbled.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Don’t be impudent, Charlie! Every word you say convinces me more and\n",
      "more of the truth of my conviction. Now do be reasonable, my dear\n",
      "child——’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I won’t be called your “dear child.”’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘My dear boy, then.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Nor your “dear boy.”’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What then, my dear Mr. Sandilands? Oh, you baby! If you were fifty-two\n",
      "instead of twenty-two, you would be skipping with pleasure at being\n",
      "called a child. However, I will try not to hurt your feelings again. I\n",
      "won’t call you “dear” at all.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No, Hilda! don’t say that.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Confess, then, that you made a mistake the other day at Norwood, and\n",
      "that I, with my independent spirit and intolerance of control, would\n",
      "never have made you happy in the way you wished me to do.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I will confess no such thing!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But your heart is not broken, Charlie. Come!’ I said, looking round\n",
      "into his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "He caught my glance and smiled.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Eureka!’ I exclaimed; ‘I knew I should get at the truth at last.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well! of course it’s not _broken_,’ he replied, in a foolish,\n",
      "half-shamed manner; ‘or I shouldn’t be walking here, but you made me\n",
      "very miserable, you know, Hilda! I am sure I hardly ate anything for a\n",
      "month after you left. But you had said it was of no use, and you never\n",
      "should change your mind, and so I tried to make the best of it. A man\n",
      "cannot go on crying over spilt milk for ever, can he?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Of course not,’ I said energetically; ‘and it is so brave and nice of\n",
      "you to tell me the truth, Charlie. It makes me feel we shall be such\n",
      "real friends henceforward. And I want your friendship so much. I should\n",
      "have been unhappy to think that you had put it out of my power to\n",
      "confide in you; for things are not quite so straight here as they ought\n",
      "to be.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What! with the Lovetts! Aren’t they kind to you?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The girls are sweetness itself. I never had more lovable companions.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The one I saw first seemed very jolly; the pretty one, I mean!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What, Tessie? the one with fair hair?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh! we call little Ange the beauty! Her face is perfectly lovely when\n",
      "you look into it.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I didn’t see so much of her. She kept right behind her sister. But Miss\n",
      "Lovett appeared the prettiest girl I had ever seen, to me—except\n",
      "yourself, Hilda, of course,’ added Charlie, pulling himself up with a\n",
      "sudden recollection of the proprieties.\n",
      "\n",
      "I laughed so heartily that I entirely discomposed him.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh, Charlie! you have not half learned your lesson yet! I know I’m a\n",
      "very pretty girl, because you’ve so often told me so; but I do not\n",
      "expect nor wish that you should never meet somebody you think much\n",
      "better-looking than myself. And Tessie Lovett and I are formed upon two\n",
      "such entirely opposite models! How could you think my wounded vanity\n",
      "would require that little postscript of yours as salve?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I’ll tell you what I _do_ think, Hilda,’ said Charlie, with sudden\n",
      "bluntness, ‘and that is, that you are the most honest and\n",
      "straightforward woman I’ve ever known; and I’m sure the man who gets you\n",
      "will be an out-and-out lucky fellow, whoever he may be.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, never mind him, Charlie; he has not appeared upon the scene as\n",
      "yet, so we can go on very well without him. Tessie has, as you say, a\n",
      "very sweet and pretty face, and the goodness of her heart shines through\n",
      "her eyes and makes it beautiful. She has a great deal of trouble and\n",
      "anxiety to bear, and she bears it with the utmost meekness and patience.\n",
      "I have a great affection for her, and I hope I shall live to see her the\n",
      "wife of some good man whose love will make up for the sorrows of her\n",
      "youth. And as this brings me to the very point on which I want to\n",
      "consult you, Charlie, suppose we sit down on this bank whilst I tell you\n",
      "my difficulties.’\n",
      "\n",
      "We had reached the Calvary now, the very place where I had first met the\n",
      "Mère Fromard, and were as much alone and more secure from listeners than\n",
      "if we had been shut up within four walls. So I commenced to recount the\n",
      "perplexity in which I found myself with regard to money—the attempts I\n",
      "had made to procure it and the failures that had succeeded them—and\n",
      "ended by asking him to tell me whether it would be advisable to\n",
      "communicate with Mr. Warrington on the subject, or to wait and see what\n",
      "time might bring me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had called Charlie Sandilands a ‘baby,’ and in some things a young man\n",
      "in love, or supposing himself to be so, is a very great baby compared to\n",
      "an energetic and helpful woman with all her wits about her. Yet I knew\n",
      "when it came to a question of business, _pur et simple_, that his\n",
      "decision would be worth twenty of mine, being less likely to be actuated\n",
      "by any other feeling than a desire to see justice done to his friend.\n",
      "His advice was that I should write without any delay to Mr. Warrington,\n",
      "and tell him all I knew.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Who had the management of your mother’s affairs during her lifetime,\n",
      "Hilda?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Mr. Lovett entirely, I believe; at least, you see it was on this wise,\n",
      "Charlie. My mother had a small pension granted to her by Government, on\n",
      "account of my father’s scientific discoveries being adopted by the\n",
      "nation, but that dies with her. The only real property my father left\n",
      "behind him consists of shares in a tea-raising company in the Himalayas,\n",
      "producing annually one hundred and fifty pounds, and that is the money\n",
      "for which Mr. Lovett is still trustee for me.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But there should be two trustees, Hilda.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There were two, I think; but the other one died, and mamma never\n",
      "appointed a successor to him. Mr. Warrington mentioned something about\n",
      "it to me, I remember, but I forgot it again. Will you be the other\n",
      "trustee, Charlie?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I should like to be so very much, but I cannot say if I am fitted for\n",
      "such a post. You had better ask Warrington. Used Mr. Lovett to send you\n",
      "mamma the interest of these shares regularly?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I don’t think he did, of late years; but it always came eventually, or\n",
      "we should not have been able to live. It seems very strange, though,\n",
      "that now he should be unable to lay his hand on a few pounds for me,\n",
      "does it not?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I don’t like it at all, Hilda, and I wish you would write to Warrington\n",
      "about it by this night’s post.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Suppose my letter should bring him over here?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘All the better if it is necessary! You may be sure he will not come\n",
      "unless he considers it so.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I shall tell him with twice the confidence now that I have had your\n",
      "advice, Charlie. I was so very undecided whether to write to him or your\n",
      "mother. In fact, I had begun a letter to Mrs. Sandilands when you\n",
      "arrived.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Mother couldn’t have advised you on her own responsibility. It isn’t a\n",
      "matter for a woman’s decision—nor for a man’s, except he be a lawyer. I\n",
      "hope Warrington may ask you to sell out your shares and invest them in\n",
      "something else. I don’t like tea; it’s so very uncertain. A rainy\n",
      "season—or a dry one—might deprive you of half your income.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘That would be awkward! But I confess to an entire and appalling\n",
      "ignorance concerning shares and selling out and all that kind of thing.\n",
      "I am afraid I did not even know where the money came from till Mr.\n",
      "Warrington told me.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘That is not like your usual sense, Hilda; and since it is all you have\n",
      "to depend upon, I should think the sooner you made yourself acquainted\n",
      "with its source and securities the better.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes, I feel I have been foolish. There is another thing, Charlie. Do\n",
      "you think I could get my money into my own hands? Mr. Warrington\n",
      "promised me I should be quite independent, and I should feel so much\n",
      "more so if I paid Mr. Lovett what we agreed upon, instead of having it\n",
      "kept back from me like a child.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I should say it would be not only feasible but right that you should\n",
      "manage your own income. I don’t think you have been treated at all\n",
      "fairly, Hilda, and I have not conceived a very high idea of your\n",
      "reverend guardian in consequence.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You had better wait till you see him and judge for yourself, Charlie.\n",
      "You know the old adage, “What is one man’s meat is another man’s\n",
      "poison.” I may have been viewing the old gentleman through distorted\n",
      "lenses. But I fear the rosiest glasses would never make him look a saint\n",
      "to me again.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Who’s that foreign-looking chap staring at you, Hilda?’ interposed\n",
      "Charlie, abruptly.\n",
      "\n",
      "I followed his glance and encountered the graceful form of the Baron de\n",
      "Nesselrode. He was attired in a velveteen shooting-suit of a\n",
      "golden-brown hue; had a game-bag slung across his shoulder, and carried\n",
      "a gun in his hand. Following at his heels were several dogs, amongst\n",
      "which the two gaunt wolf-hounds that we had seen at the château\n",
      "contributed to form a most picturesque group.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the Baron met my gaze, he smiled slightly, lifted his _sombrero_, and\n",
      "with a low bow passed on his way. But not before I had caught the look\n",
      "of decided dissatisfaction he threw towards my companion, who was\n",
      "sitting very close to me upon the bank. The look annoyed me, though I\n",
      "scarcely knew why. I certainly did not wish Monsieur de Nesselrode nor\n",
      "anybody else in St. Pucelle to think I was indulging in a flirtation\n",
      "with Charlie Sandilands, but at the same time I liked him too well to\n",
      "see any slight cast upon him without inwardly resenting it. So a blight\n",
      "fell on my spirits as the Baron passed out of sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Who is he? do you know him?’ asked Charlie, as soon as we were alone\n",
      "again.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Of course I know him, or I should not have returned his bow. That is\n",
      "the Baron de Nesselrode—a great friend of all the Lovetts—and a\n",
      "particular one of Tessie’s.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘A particular friend of Miss Lovett’s!’ repeated my companion. ‘How do\n",
      "you mean?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I mean what I say; and I hope and think that at some future time he\n",
      "will be more than a friend to her. They would make a charming couple,\n",
      "for he is so thoroughly well-bred and courtier-like, and she has been\n",
      "reared in the atmosphere of a Court, although her father is now too poor\n",
      "to permit them to mix in society.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Do you mean that he’ll marry her?’ demanded Charlie, who was rather\n",
      "dull of comprehension.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What else do you suppose I could mean? Nothing is settled, remember;\n",
      "but the Baron wants a wife terribly, and Tessie is so sweet, I think she\n",
      "would love anybody who was kind to her.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, I should have thought she could do a deal better than that for\n",
      "herself.’\n",
      "\n",
      "This disparaging remark was a signal-match for my bad temper, and I\n",
      "fired up immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What a commonplace manner you have of expressing your ideas, Charlie.\n",
      "Besides, you do not know what you’re talking about. Monsieur de\n",
      "Nesselrode belongs to one of the first and oldest families of France.\n",
      "His ancestors have been barons by feudal right ever since the days of\n",
      "Charlemagne; and if it were not that he had been a little wild and\n",
      "careless of his money, you would not have seen him in a place like St.\n",
      "Pucelle at all. The Château des Roses, which he occupies here, is the\n",
      "least important portion of his estates. He possesses land in\n",
      "Switzerland, and Normandy, and Anjou, and is the owner of extensive\n",
      "house property in Paris. The De Nesselrodes have been attached to the\n",
      "King’s service ever since one of their ancestors saved a royal life. I\n",
      "believe you would not find better blood in all France than runs in the\n",
      "veins of the gentleman who has just passed us.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, you seem to know all about him, at any rate, Hilda,’ replied\n",
      "Charlie, when want of breath compelled me to stop my running commentary\n",
      "on the Baron’s pedigree. ‘I dare say it’s all true, but his title and\n",
      "estates don’t alter my opinion one bit. I should still think Miss Lovett\n",
      "a great deal too good for him.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But why? He is very handsome and accomplished, and you know nothing\n",
      "against his character?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘He’s a Frenchman! that’s quite enough for me,’ said Charlie, with\n",

      "\n",
      "_He used to dare to think!_ He cast his calculating untrue eyes upon me\n",

      "only trying how far he could impose on my credulity and make me think\n",
      "him blameless. The idea nerved me for action. Had I followed the bent of\n",
      "my inclinations, I should have hurled indignant reproaches on his head,\n",
      "and made him, in consequence, believe that his conduct had still the\n",
      "power to pain me. But I stamped on my inclination, and answered him as\n",

      "recollections whatever, pleasant or unpleasant, with regard to himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And so I did,’ I replied. ‘I had so few companions of my own age at\n",

      "milliner’s apprentice, whom he picked up in the streets carrying a\n",

      "At this juncture I slipped out of the room to put on my hat and see if I\n",

      "\n",
      "I saw he was offended, but I could not help it. The conversation we had\n",
      "held that morning was too fresh in both our minds. He would have renewed\n",
      "the subject, which, as far as I was concerned, was exhausted. I had\n",
      "nothing more to say about it, and I feared lest in discussion I might be\n",
      "led to betray my past regard for him. Besides, although I wished him no\n",
      "harm, I did not consider that Mr. Charteris’s behaviour to me entitled\n",
      "him to rank as one of my friends. He had proved himself false, fickle,\n",
      "and cold-hearted. No man can have worse attributes for any position in\n",
      "life. He was not worthy of any woman’s confidence or regard, and I was\n",
      "quite sure he could never have more from me than my acquaintance.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a luscious, balmy evening, with just sufficient coolness to make\n",
      "walking a pleasure. To leave the clang of that woman’s tongue behind me,\n",
      "and to encounter the soft stilly atmosphere, was like entering a church\n",
      "from a public-house. I breathed more freely as I found myself alone, at\n",
      "liberty to think without disturbance. It was but just six o’clock. The\n",
      "shadows had not yet fallen to blot out the beautiful, delicate hues of\n",
      "the wild-flowers that bordered the roadway; nor to hush the evening\n",
      "hymns of the birds that were singing from every bough.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would not take my favourite walk, which led towards the Château des\n",
      "Roses, because I was alone, and a silly fear of ridicule from Tessie and\n",
      "her sister always made me avoid anything that looked like a desire to\n",
      "meet the Baron de Nesselrode. So, as soon as the house I had quitted was\n",
      "out of sight, I struck up a side-path which led in the opposite\n",
      "direction and towards the forest of Piron. This forest, which has been\n",
      "rendered so celebrated by poets and writers of romance, is still the\n",
      "great point to which the eyes of all sportsmen in the Wallon are\n",
      "lovingly directed, although the march of civilisation has here, as\n",
      "everywhere else, driven the larger game farther and farther back into\n",
      "the recesses of their covert, until it is now as difficult to find them\n",
      "as it was once to extirpate them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many stories had been told me of the difficulties encountered even by\n",
      "the royal sportsmen of the realm, in their desire to obtain good\n",
      "specimens of wolves, boars and wild turkeys from the forest of Piron;\n",
      "and Armand de Nesselrode had been quoted in my presence as the most\n",
      "successful hunter that had been known to penetrate it. The floor of his\n",
      "hall at the château was covered with wolf-skins, the contemplation of\n",
      "which had more than once made me shudder as I thought of the risks he\n",
      "must have run in procuring them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cave Charteris and he were constantly together at this time, shooting on\n",
      "horseback and on foot, and the bags of small game which the former used\n",
      "to bring home for our table proved that there were plenty of other marks\n",
      "in the forest besides those dangerous wolves and thrice dangerous wild\n",
      "boars.\n",
      "\n",
      "I knew the road to it well. It was lonely; but we never associated\n",
      "danger with loneliness at St. Pucelle; and at one point of it there\n",
      "stood a wayside shrine, a pretty, romantic, ruined piece of\n",
      "architecture, that I had sketched more than once, and from which a\n",
      "narrow path led through fields of grass and turnips back to my home\n",
      "again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Piron road had not much in it to attract the eye before this little\n",
      "shrine was reached, and I walked along its side-path rapidly, as was my\n",
      "custom to walk when alone, with my eyes cast down and my brain working\n",
      "away as fast as it could go, at every subject that passed through it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had left St. Pucelle a mile—perhaps a mile and a half—behind me, when\n",
      "something, I knew not what, impelled me suddenly to look up and scan the\n",
      "surrounding landscape. I had reached the centre of a long straight road,\n",
      "on either side of which ran a narrow footpath, fringed by the smallest\n",
      "of hedges, in many places trampled down by feet passing over it into the\n",
      "fields beyond. Not a tree sheltered the road anywhere, it was simply a\n",
      "highway to the next town. The dark mass of trees composing the forest\n",
      "loomed in the distance, but so far off as to appear like one clump\n",
      "against the greyish-blue sky of evening; behind me lay St. Pucelle, but\n",
      "I had placed a hill between us, and could only see the top of the spire\n",
      "of St. Marie and the wreaths of smoke that ascended from a little\n",
      "factory at the bottom of the town. I cast my eyes again in front. What\n",
      "was that dark figure advancing to meet me, that was sometimes in the\n",
      "light and sometimes in the shade, and seemed so uncertain in its\n",
      "movements and designs? Could it be a donkey? I smiled as the idea\n",
      "crossed my mind.\n",

      "\n",
      "I wondered for a moment, then, why he should have elected to tell it to\n",

      "\n",
      "‘I have never had the happiness to possess a mother, a sister, or even a\n",
      "female relation sufficiently near to whom I could confide my sorrows or\n",
      "my perplexities. From a little child I was brought up in the society of\n",
      "men, and taught, as far as possible, to guide myself. That circumstance\n",
      "has been a terrible drawback to me, mademoiselle.’\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "‘And not afterwards?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Not so much afterwards! The mother is the God of the child, monsieur,\n",
      "and if a boy has a good, true, pure-hearted mother who loves him, he can\n",
      "have no better friend nor _confidante_ than herself, until he becomes a\n",
      "man. But then their positions should alter. The _man_ who leans upon his\n",
      "mother is a milksop. He should be her protector—her guide—even her\n",
      "counsellor. It is thus that women are rewarded for the care and pains\n",
      "with which they have watched over the infancy of their little ones.’\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "‘My mother died when I was quite a baby. She was very beautiful, and my\n",
      "father, who held a high position at Court, was so distracted by her loss\n",
      "that he threw up his appointment, left all his friends, and wandered for\n",
      "many years in foreign countries. Meanwhile, I was transferred from my\n",
      "nurse’s arms to those of a private tutor, whose house I left only to go\n",
      "to college. I had an uncle on the mother’s side, Le Sieur de Beaupré,\n",
      "the father of the cousin to whom I told you I was once betrothed. This\n",
      "betrothal was contracted when I was very young—not yet sixteen, whilst\n",
      "Blanche had only completed her fourteenth year. We were betrothed with\n",
      "the consent and at the desire of my father, who was at that time\n",
      "wandering about the Brazils, and expressed his intention of not\n",
      "returning to Paris until I had passed through the _Athénée_, and was\n",
      "ready to be married. I had grown, therefore, up to eighteen years of age\n",
      "without ever having seen my father.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What a sad, desolate childhood!’ I exclaimed; ‘and how different from\n",
      "mine, monsieur! My father died, it is true, but my dear mother never\n",
      "left me, day nor night, from the hour of my birth. No wonder that you\n",
      "should have gone wrong, without affection, counsel, or home. Those who\n",
      "left you so are more to blame for what followed than you are.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You pity me, mademoiselle?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I do indeed! From the bottom of my heart! I see you as a child and a\n",
      "growing man, lonely and unloved, and I could weep for the many desolate\n",
      "and unhappy hours you must have passed.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘_Que le bon Dieu te bénisse!_’ he said softly, as he lifted the hand\n",
      "that was lying idly on my lap to his lips, and let it quickly drop\n",
      "again. The action sent the blood rushing to both our faces, and for a\n",
      "minute or two we were silent altogether.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes! I was very unhappy at that period,’ continued the Baron. ‘It\n",
      "seemed to me that Heaven was unjust in so unequally dividing its\n",
      "favours. I had every luxury, because my father was rich, but I would\n",
      "have exchanged them all for a caress when I went to bed at night, or for\n",
      "the touch of a soft hand upon my head. I saw other fathers proud of\n",
      "their sons, and I wondered what I had done that mine should never care\n",
      "to see or hear from me, and scarcely took the trouble to write home to\n",
      "ask if I were dead or alive. Such thoughts embittered my mind and made\n",
      "it callous, and after I entered the _Athénée_ and joined the wild band\n",
      "of students assembled within its walls, I soon became the wildest of\n",
      "them all, and well known to the authorities as a dangerous leader into\n",
      "all sorts of mischief. Why should I not be? what was there to restrain\n",
      "me? No mother’s look of pain—no father’s frown—nothing but a\n",
      "remonstrance from Monsieur de Beaupré, that my allowance did not last\n",
      "long enough, and that if I could not moderate my expenses he should be\n",
      "obliged to inform his brother-in-law. So things went on till I was\n",
      "twenty-one, when the news reached Paris of my father’s death. I came\n",
      "into my title and my fortune, and was considered to be one of the best\n",
      "matches in Paris. But, mademoiselle, I am fatiguing you. Why should I be\n",
      "so vain as to imagine that all these paltry details can hold any\n",
      "interest for you?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Indeed, monsieur, I am deeply interested. Pray believe me when I say\n",
      "so.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Why should I tell this tale of folly and dissipation to you?’ he went\n",
      "on, musingly; ‘I knew I should have to confess it some day, to the woman\n",
      "I should make my wife—if such an event ever happens—but I never thought\n",
      "to disclose it before. _Hélas!_ this world brings strange things to\n",
      "pass! As soon as my uncle Beaupré heard of my father’s death, he tried\n",
      "to persuade me to complete the marriage with his daughter at once, but I\n",
      "was averse to the idea of tying myself down so soon, and refused to do\n",
      "so until the time named in the contract, which was on the attainment of\n",
      "my twenty-fourth year. I left the _Athénée_, of course, and, settling in\n",
      "my own _hôtel_, on the Boulevards des Tuileries, plunged, with the aid\n",
      "of my old college companions, into every sort of dissipation. Will\n",
      "mademoiselle pardon me for mentioning such a thing?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We are better used to the mention of it in England, monsieur, than your\n",
      "ladies are in Paris, although we recognise its necessity less, and\n",
      "deplore its existence more. We Englishwomen are permitted to know that\n",
      "our men lead very different lives from ourselves, but we are taught at\n",
      "the same time that, for that very reason, it behoves us to be all the\n",
      "purer and more discreet, in order to win them back to a right and\n",
      "virtuous living.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And you do so win them! In all the world there are no such lovers of\n",
      "domestic life as there are in England.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I believe it,’ I answered, for I am very proud of and very devoted to\n",
      "my own country-people, whatever friends I may have found in other\n",
      "nations.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I am speaking now, mademoiselle, of ten years ago—when the first notes\n",
      "of that terrible discord that shook France to her foundations were\n",
      "beginning to be heard, and Paris was in a state of ferment and\n",
      "expectation. The revolution had not commenced, but disaffection was\n",
      "already pre-evident amongst the labouring classes, and _émeutes_ and\n",
      "brawls were of hourly occurrence in the city. It was on the occasion of\n",
      "the last night of the old year, which devotees celebrate in the churches\n",
      "and roysterers in the streets. I was returning home after the theatre\n",
      "with some of my friends, about the hour of midnight mass, when, just\n",
      "outside the church of the Madeleine, I saw a young girl standing up\n",
      "against the wall, and prevented from passing on her way by a band of\n",
      "tipsy artisans who surrounded her, calling out, “_A bas_ the\n",
      "aristocrat!”—“Pull off her hood and rub her face in the mud!”—“Down on\n",
      "her knees and make her pray for the _bonnets rouges_!” and other phrases\n",
      "of similar import. You may suppose that was more than I and my friends\n",
      "could stand, and we went at once to her rescue. The poor child caught\n",
      "hold of my arm, crying, “Oh! save me, monsieur; I am no aristocrat. My\n",
      "father is a commoner, and lives but a couple of streets from here.” A\n",
      "few blows and rough words soon dispersed the rioters, and I took the\n",
      "young lady home under my protection. I found that her name was Corinne\n",
      "Duplat, and her father was a man of letters. She was very beautiful——’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh yes, I know! You needn’t tell me,’ I interrupted him, impatiently.\n",
      "‘She was the loveliest creature you had ever seen, and you became\n",
      "enamoured of her at once. You can skip all that! I have heard it so\n",
      "often before.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The Baron fixed his dark eyes upon me with an expression of the greatest\n",
      "surprise. After all my amiability and interest, he did not know what to\n",
      "make of the sudden change. I suppose I looked as sulky as a bear, for he\n",
      "immediately began to apologise.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I felt I should weary mademoiselle. Let me say no more than to thank\n",
      "you for the patience with which you have listened to me.’\n",
      "\n",
      "But this was not what I wanted.\n",
      "\n",

      "wounded.\n",

      "myself.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No, no, monsieur! Do not think so. It was only because I was in such\n",
      "haste to hear the end of the story. Go on about Corinne! She was very\n",
      "beautiful, and you loved her!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I _thought_ I loved her,’ he corrected me, gently. ‘I was very young\n",
      "and knew no better; I have found out since what true love is.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes, monsieur?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Her father neglected her dreadfully, and let her go anywhere alone,\n",
      "which is unheard of amongst young ladies in Paris. It was natural that\n",
      "after a while I should constitute myself her protector. She was only\n",
      "seventeen, and very fragile—almost ethereal in appearance; and when I\n",
      "had known her for about six months, I felt I should like to make her my\n",
      "wife. I forgot my betrothal to my cousin Blanche. All my wishes centred\n",
      "in the hope of marrying Corinne. I broached the subject one day to her\n",

      "looked so healthy, though delicate. I urged Monsieur Duplat to permit\n",
      "the marriage to take place, and I believe it would have been\n",
      "accomplished, had a sudden chill not taken the poor child off before\n",
      "another month was over her head.’\n",

      "was a _littérateur_ whose very uncertain income was dependent on his\n",
      "humour for writing, and unfortunately his humour too often took the\n",
      "direction of drinking instead. In my sorrow for the loss of Corinne, I\n",
      "conceived the romantic idea of being a son to her father, and invited\n",
      "the old man to come and live with me in my hôtel. I had so much money,\n",
      "there was plenty for us both. Why should he not enjoy it also? Amidst\n",
      "all my former dissipations I had never been a gambler, and it was\n",
      "Monsieur Duplat himself who had on our first acquaintanceship introduced\n",
      "me to the gaming-tables of Paris. After he came to live with me,\n",
      "idleness and regret for his daughter’s death seemed to drive him to them\n",
      "oftener than before, and wherever he went I accompanied him. I felt\n",

      "believed, like most young mourners, that I should never be happy again,\n",
      "and it did not signify what became of me. This is how I contracted the\n",
      "spirit of gaming. Two of us were drawing on my (apparently)\n",
      "inexhaustible fortune at the same moment, for you may be sure I paid all\n",
      "Duplat’s debts before my own. My uncle Beaupré was not long in hearing\n",
      "of my lavish expenditure, and remonstrated with me in his daughter’s\n",
      "name. But a devil seemed to have entered into me—and when I found that I\n",
      "had caused a large portion of my fortune to disappear, I attempted to\n",
      "remedy the evil by staking more recklessly than before. At last the\n",
      "crash came, and my eyes were opened. Monsieur Duplat had persuaded me to\n",
      "stand security for an extravagant sum of money by which, as he said, he\n",
      "was to be made independent for life, and the day after he got it he\n",
      "decamped, leaving me in the lurch to meet all his liabilities as well as\n",
      "my own. The creditors swooped down upon me like birds of prey. I found\n",
      "that Duplat had procured valuables all over the town in my name, besides\n",
      "forging it for a large amount of ready money from my bankers, and I was\n",
      "literally ruined.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What an ingrate!’ I exclaimed. ‘Oh, monsieur! I am sure that, with your\n",

      "glad that she was safe in heaven, and freed from it all. My uncle came\n",
      "to Paris as soon as he knew of my ruin, and informed me that all idea of\n",
      "a marriage between _mademoiselle ma cousine_ and myself was at an end,\n",

      "up his nose at one of the best and sweetest creatures God ever made,\n",

      "How he laughed at the idea! I had never heard Armand de Nesselrode laugh\n",

      "‘No, no, no!’ I exclaimed hastily, as I jumped up from my grassy seat,\n",
      "and shook the dust from my skirts. ‘I don’t want to hear it, monsieur: I\n",

      "\n",
      "‘You must not come this way again alone, since you are easily\n",
      "frightened, mademoiselle. But if you will let me know—me only, you\n",
      "understand, it is not necessary we should tell our private affairs to\n",
      "all the world—when you intend to make your promenade upon the Piron\n",
      "road, I will take care to be within call—not to intrude upon your\n",
      "privacy, but to be ready in case you desire to appeal to me for\n",
      "assistance.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Was he laughing at me, or did he imagine it possible I could permit him\n",
      "to follow at my heels like a dog or a lacquey, waiting to receive my\n",
      "orders? I glanced up at his face, expecting to see a twinkle in his eyes\n",
      "which should prove he was only in jest, but they were solemn as those of\n",
      "a judge. The Baron de Nesselrode, in his beautiful chivalry and devotion\n",
      "to the weaker sex, had been really in earnest in making this offer. But\n",
      "of course I rejected it.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It is impossible!’ I replied. ‘You must not dream of such a thing. You\n",

      "\n",
      "‘You think I would be barbarous enough to take advantage of such a trust\n",
      "by forcing my conversation upon you! Ah, mademoiselle, you do me wrong!\n",
      "No saint in her niche could be farther removed from the annoyance of my\n",
      "presence than you should be, if you thought fit to accept my protection\n",
      "in your solitary rambles.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But I shall not come this way again, monsieur, when I am by myself. And\n",

      "not used to be attended on, nor to have a _preux-chevalier_ at my heels,\n",
      "thank you all the same for thinking of it!’\n",
      "\n",
      "We were walking back to St. Pucelle together now, through the field-path\n",
      "that I have mentioned. It was a very narrow way; there was scarcely room\n",

      "impeded.\n",

      "‘At first I considered the possibility of turning my talents, such as\n",
      "they are, to account, in any post of responsibility that a gentleman\n",
      "might accept. But whilst I remain under the black cloud of debt, there\n",

      "servitude is ended.’\n",

      "to wish to correct them. I am infinitely obliged, but what am I to say\n",
      "about it? What would your relations think if they heard that a De\n",

      "appointments with gentlemen without the knowledge of our friends is\n",

      "heads close together and their eyes cast on the ground. The Baron and I\n",
      "were walking one after the other, duck fashion, but our two friends were\n",
      "side by side.\n",
      "\n",

      "As I mooted the question, I thought of Miss Markham. I knew how silly\n",
      "and romantic she was, delighting in moonlight walks and secret\n",
      "assignations, and could imagine how she had waylaid Cave Charteris\n",
      "smoking under the garden wall, and dragged him out into the fields, with\n",
      "his will or against it. A man can hardly refuse a woman’s request point\n",
      "blank to her face.\n",

      "almost ran into Mr. Charteris’s arms.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Here is an encounter!’ I said merrily. The woman by his side lifted her\n",
      "head, and, to my utter astonishment, I saw the beautiful face of Angela\n",

      "her cavalier. I supposed it was very natural she should do so. I had\n",
      "left him smoking sulkily under the garden wall, and when she came out\n",
      "for her evening stroll, he had probably proffered the same request to\n",
      "her that he did to me, and she could hardly have refused him. What\n",

      "young and unsophisticated, and her father was far too careless of her.\n",
      "Yet what business was it of mine? The fear of being thought meddlesome\n",

      "Since the day that we had visited the Fromards’ cottage together, I had\n",
      "not breathed a word to her of the disclosures that had been made me\n",
      "there. Poor Guillaume had been taken to his last home. And the funeral\n",
      "_cortége_, followed by half the town, had passed our door without my\n",
      "making the slightest reference to the unpleasant topic which the sight\n",
      "brought to my mind. I had even listened with patience to the beautiful\n",

      "suspect me of treachery, and was afraid that, notwithstanding my\n",
      "promise, I should enlighten Ange upon the subject? Or had her father\n",
      "represented my conduct to her in his own light, and made her feel\n",
      "resentment on his account? I could not tell. I only knew that something\n",
      "had arisen between us, and we were not on the friendly terms we had been\n",
      "hitherto. Mr. Charteris was another defaulter, though regarding his\n",

      "Anyway, from that day he devoted himself to outdoor amusements, and\n",
      "scarcely seemed to be in the house for ten minutes together. Last, but\n",
      "not least, dear little Ange began to brood and be melancholy, in common\n",
      "with the rest. The season was not a healthy one, and there was a great\n",
      "deal of fever and sickness amongst the poor people. Perhaps this\n",
      "somewhat accounted for the decrease of brilliancy in her eyes, and lack\n",
      "of power in her limbs. Her slight delicate frame was weakened by the\n",
      "long hot summer, and required the dry frost of winter to brace and set\n",

      "\n",
      "Tessie did not see it as I did. She said that St. Pucelle was always\n",

      "much the same as usual. From the ‘little maid’ herself I could get no\n",
      "satisfactory information. She had become as shy of me as her sister, and\n",
      "seemed quite nervous of being left in the same room.\n",

      "next few weeks imperative business would keep him in London, but that as\n",
      "soon as it was concluded he should run over to St. Pucelle, and inquire\n",

      "back, and begged Mr. Warrington to try first what he could do by letter.\n",
      "But my friend dissuaded me from interfering in the matter. In the first\n",
      "place, he pointed out that the lawyer must know his own business best;\n",
      "in the second, that an epistolary war between him and Mr. Lovett would\n",
      "be none the pleasanter for me than a wordy one, and I should be\n",
      "compelled to bear the brunt of it without the weight of Mr. Warrington’s\n",
      "presence to back me.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was much good sense in this advice, which I resolved to take, and\n",
      "Charlie and I had many discussions as we trod the lonely environs of St.\n",

      "for me to adopt, for that I should be able to continue in any comfort\n",

      "\n",
      "Somewhere near Tessie and Ange I resolved if possible to stay, but not\n",
      "under the same roof-tree. Charlie talked of Germany and Italy, and the\n",
      "delight the art treasures of these countries would afford to my æsthetic\n",
      "tastes, but somehow I could not make up my mind to leave St. Pucelle. It\n",
      "was a stupid, pottering little town, true enough, and I knew every inch\n",
      "of it by that time, and I had no ties to keep me there; still, whatever\n",

      "\n",
      "One day, on an unusually oppressive afternoon, about the middle of\n",
      "October, I substituted a white cambric dressing-gown for the heavy\n",
      "mourning robes I still wore, and sat down in my own room for a couple of\n",
      "hours’ quiet reading. I had been thinking of all the disagreeable things\n",

      "my mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Charlie had brought over several cheap novels with him for the\n",
      "nourishment of his mental appetite, and I had greedily pounced upon one\n",

      "Ange dressed for walking as I entered the corridor, on her way to the\n",
      "kitchen to fetch the basket which she usually carried when visiting the\n",
      "poor, and I had remonstrated with the child for exposing herself to such\n",

      "insisted upon being so obstinate.\n",
      "\n",
      "But she had only shaken her head at me in reply, and I had considered my\n",

      "Miss Braddon. I had heard light steps traverse the corridor and leave\n",
      "the house by way of the garden, and thought what a little saint of love\n",
      "and charity the child was, and how far behind her I came in all things\n",
      "worthy of praise, when the latch of my door was softly raised (all the\n",
      "doors in St. Pucelle were latched instead of locked), and lo! the face\n",

      "\n",
      "‘No, it was Tessie. I felt so tired that she took the basket from my\n",

      "is glaring in on the other side of the house till it is like an oven.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Come in then, dear, and sit with me. I have got one of the most\n",

      "stool at my feet and rested her head against my knee.\n",
      "\n",
      "I read aloud for a few minutes, but I soon found that even Miss Braddon\n",
      "had not the power to-day to chain Ange’s wandering thoughts, which, it\n",
      "was plain to see from the expression of her dreamy eyes, were far away\n",

      "I nursed her the very day she was born. Such a dear, fat little thing\n",

      "\n",
      "‘What did she die of?’\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "‘Perhaps so, but you are too young to believe it. You have all your life\n",

      "my knee. Was it my fancy, or had a look of greater age really come over\n",
      "Ange’s childlike features during the last few weeks? I thought her nose\n",
      "seemed longer and thinner than before, and that her brows were not quite\n",
      "so smooth and open as they had been. But it must have been my fancy, or\n",
      "the appearance was merely evanescent. No storm, domestic or otherwise,\n",
      "had occurred to ruffle the even tenor of her life. The unusual look of\n",

      "\n",
      "I was vexed at this retailed piece of scandal, nevertheless; though what\n",
      "else could I have expected at the hands of a set of chattering old\n",
      "women, who had seen me walking out every afternoon with the same\n",
      "gentleman?\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I suppose I have no right to be angry,’ I continued; ‘but it is always\n",

      "Ange. He is younger than I am, and I look upon him as a brother. Don’t\n",
      "let any one connect our names together again in your presence, will\n",
      "you?’\n",

      "of any of my private affairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "It seemed hopeless to engage in conversation that afternoon. Every\n",
      "subject we started came to a dead-lock, and I returned to my novel with\n",
      "an impatient sigh. Presently Madame Marmoret’s harsh voice rung out\n",
      "across the courtyard in expostulation with some one unseen.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘_Eh bien!_ you are there again, pig! Have you come to bring me what I\n",

      "manner.\n",
      "\n",

      "beautiful inconsistency, ‘it is no such great matter. Men borrow money\n",
      "of one another constantly.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘_It is no such great matter!_’ she repeated slowly; ‘no matter that\n",

      "moment, and thought, with a pang, what a blow the disclosure of the\n",
      "truth, when it came, would be to her! At that moment the bedroom door\n",
      "opened, and Tessie appeared. The sight of her sister seemed to rouse\n",
      "Ange to action, for she leapt to her feet and rushed into her arms,\n",
      "crying:\n",

      "‘Tessie! Tessie! tell the truth. Does papa owe money to Mr. Charteris?’\n",

      "which I read too well.\n",
      "\n",

      "At these words Tessie’s face became as white as the ‘little maid’s.’\n",

      "poor?’ she said, with a self-condemnatory air.\n",
      "\n",
      "I knew what she meant. That if Madame had known that _petite_ Ange was\n",
      "anywhere within hearing, she would have placed some restraint upon her\n",
      "unruly tongue.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, it cannot be helped, Tessie; and, after all, Ange is making a\n",
      "great fuss about a very little thing. She merely heard Madame say that\n",
      "Mr. Lovett had borrowed a five-pound note of his boarder.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Five pounds,Tessie; one hundred and twenty-five francs!’ said Ange,\n",
      "with open eyes of horror; ‘and how will he ever pay it back again, so\n",
      "poor as we are?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh! leave papa to find out the ways and means, darling,’ replied\n",
      "Tessie, cheerfully; ‘it is no concern of ours, you know, and he would\n",
      "not like, perhaps, to think that we knew about his private concerns.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘That is just what I have been telling her, Tessie; but Ange is such a\n",
      "little goose, she seems to think five pounds a perfect fortune.\n",
      "Gentlemen constantly accommodate each other in such trifles. Mr.\n",
      "Charteris is sure to have his money back in a day or two, and, for my\n",
      "part, I think we have wasted too much time already in discussing the\n",
      "business.’\n",
      "\n",
      "So I said, in my desire to reassure them both, but Ange still continued\n",
      "to look up in her sister’s face with wide, imploring eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Tessie, how can he pay him back? I heard papa tell the _facteur_ this\n",

      "\n",
      "‘That was because he had no change,’ I interposed quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Tessie, how will he ever be able to pay back five pounds?’ continued\n",
      "Ange, without heeding my interruption; ‘there are so many things to buy\n",
      "each day, and Madame killed our best pair of pigeons this morning\n",
      "because she had no money to go to market with.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh, Ange! you do not understand such things. You have had no\n",
      "experience. People may have very little money to-day and plenty\n",
      "to-morrow. It _comes in_, you know. The richest are sometimes out of\n",
      "pocket for a few days, aren’t they, Hilda?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Of course,’ I answered stoutly. ‘I dare say the Duke of Westminster has\n",
      "to borrow sometimes. The more we have, the more we spend. How very much\n",
      "amused Mr. Charteris would be if he could hear the debate we are holding\n",
      "over his stupid bank-note. By the way, is he home from shooting yet,\n",
      "Tessie?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I don’t know; I have not seen him,’ she replied, as she gently put her\n",
      "sister from her, and, walking up to the mirror, removed her hat and\n",
      "arranged her tumbled hair. Ange stood where she had left her for a few\n",
      "seconds motionless, and then, with a deep sigh, walked out of the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh, Hilda! how could you let her hear it?’ exclaimed Tessie, as soon as\n",
      "she was gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘How could I help it, rather? If you will gag Madame Marmoret, or reduce\n",
      "her brazen clarion of a voice to whispering music, I may be able to\n",
      "avoid such things, but not before.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘How impudent of her to shout in that way across the yard, and why does\n",
      "dear papa provoke her tongue by infringing on her premises? Why doesn’t\n",
      "he keep out of her way?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Don’t ask me. Why does everything in this world go by contraries? The\n",
      "best thing we can do now is to try and make Ange forget what she\n",
      "overheard as soon as possible.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh! she is sure to forget it. After all, it is not much. The only thing\n",
      "is to prevent its leading to more.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You had better arrange that with Madame Marmoret, since she is at the\n",
      "bottom of all the mischief.’\n",
      "\n",
      "When we met at the dinner-table I thought that Ange had already\n",
      "forgotten the little episode we had alluded to. The lovely damask colour\n",
      "bloomed once more on her cheek; her soft eyes beamed with light, and her\n",
      "manner to her father was even more tender and caressing than usual.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as the meal was concluded, she perched herself upon his knee,\n",
      "and kept on fondling him to an unusual degree as she stroked down his\n",
      "silver locks, calling him ‘Poor dear papa,’ and ‘Poor darling old\n",
      "father,’ accompanying each phrase of affection with a kiss.\n",
      "\n",
      "I fancied that Mr. Lovett palled of this excess of filial devotion, but\n",
      "the girl could not see it. Her little soft heart was full to the brim\n",
      "with compassion for what she considered the deplorable condition to\n",
      "which he had been brought, and she was powerless to perceive that his\n",
      "did not beat in unison with hers.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last he twitched his venerable head from under her smoothing hands to\n",
      "turn it towards Madame Marmoret, who entered the _salle_ with a message\n",
      "from Jean Marat, the cobbler; a humble message, delivered in the most\n",
      "respectful manner, to the effect that if it were quite convenient to\n",
      "Monsieur le Curé, would monsieur oblige Jean Marat with a few\n",
      "francs—just a few francs—on account of his bill, because madame _sa\n",
      "femme_ had laid-in that morning of the eighth little Marat, and money,\n",
      "under the circumstances, would be very acceptable.\n",
      "\n",
      "To listen to Madame’s oily voice at that moment, who would have dreamt\n",
      "it could ever be so harsh and virulent as we had heard it at other\n",

      "\n",
      "She looked the personification of a respectable servant as she stood at\n",
      "the open door with her hands rolled up in her apron; and with all my\n",
      "dislike for the woman, I recognised something touching in the restraint\n",
      "she put on her naturally evil nature for the sake of _petite_ Ange.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lovett, however, saw nothing ‘touching’ about the matter. His brows\n",
      "contracted as the message was delivered to him, and he put Ange off his\n",
      "lap with a brusqueness that was almost rough.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What do you mean by bringing such a message in to me in the midst of\n",
      "dinner?’ he demanded. ‘Tell Jean Marat to go——’\n",
      "\n",
      "But there he remembered himself and came to a full stop. Whatever he may\n",
      "have been in private, he was always very particular in keeping up the\n",
      "name of his profession in public.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Tell Jean Marat that it is _not_ convenient, that I am occupied at\n",
      "present—and he must wait,’ he continued, correcting the former sentence.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘If monsieur could spare but five francs,’ pleaded Marmoret. ‘The Marats\n",
      "are very poor.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘_Ciel!_’ exclaimed Mr. Lovett, losing his temper entirely. ‘What do you\n",
      "mean by talking to me in that manner when I haven’t got a five-franc\n",
      "piece in the house? Give it to them yourself if you are so anxious for\n",
      "their comfort; but get out of this room, and leave me in peace to finish\n",
      "my repast.’\n",

      "amongst us. But an ominous silence succeeded her departure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tessie sat with eyes downcast upon her lap. Mr. Charteris whistled and\n",
      "looked out of the window. Ange seemed restlessly miserable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cause of the disturbance tried to cheer up the spirits of his\n",
      "family, but, finding his remonstrances of no avail, took his hat and\n",
      "stick discontentedly and walked off to visit some of his friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "The girls disappeared together, as I thought, to their garden or the\n",
      "kitchen, and I retreated to the inner _salle_ to have another chat with\n",
      "Miss Braddon. When it grew too dusk to read I went upstairs, intending\n",
      "to finish some needlework or writing in my bedroom by the light of a\n",
      "little lamp which I had purchased for my own use with some of the money\n",
      "Mr. Warrington had sent me. But, passing the room occupied by the\n",
      "sisters, my attention was arrested by the sound of a low sobbing, and I\n",
      "entered it expecting to find my poor friend Tessie bewailing in secret\n",
      "the troubles she had to bear. To my surprise, however, it was not Tessie\n",
      "who was cast prostrate on the bed. It was Ange!\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Ange, my child!’ I exclaimed. ‘What is the matter that you should weep\n",

      "\n",

      "How we all came to visit the _Grottes de S. Jean_ in one large party, I\n",
      "never quite made out, but the fact remains that we went. Some one\n",
      "proposed it, probably Miss Markham (for that gay young creature was\n",
      "always on the alert to concoct a plan by which she should secure the\n",
      "privilege of Mr. Charteris’s company), and some one agreed to it, but\n",
      "neither of them was I.\n",
      "\n",
      "I found myself one morning in the centre of a group consisting of Mr.\n",
      "and Mrs. Carolus, Sophy Markham, Arthur Thrale and Charlie Sandilands,\n",
      "Cave Charteris, and Ange and Tessie, all habited in walking costumes,\n",
      "and armed with thick sticks, ready to start on an expedition to these\n",
      "famous grottoes of stalactites, and I was told to put on my hat and\n",
      "accompany them.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no particular interest to me in the expedition; indeed, had I\n",
      "been given my choice, I would much rather have stayed at home on the\n",
      "chance of getting a lesson in French from the Baron de Nesselrode—the\n",
      "public will see that I am frank in these records, even to detailing my\n",
      "errors of judgment—but consciousness that it was so, and that I showed\n",
      "weakness in encouraging it, urged me to the opposite course, and I\n",
      "agreed, with alacrity, to do all that they required of me. So in a few\n",
      "minutes we had started on our way. Sophy Markham clinging close, of\n",
      "course, to Charteris’s side, as Charlie Sandilands did to mine, and the\n",
      "rest walking, as Ange expressed it, _heegledy-peegledy_. How well I\n",
      "remember that morning: we were all so terribly young. Mrs. Carolus\n",
      "skipped round and about her Willy, whom, more than once, she nearly\n",
      "knocked over in her airy evolutions, as a bride of sixteen might have\n",
      "done; whilst Miss Markham hung upon Charteris’s arm and gazed up into\n",
      "his face with the rapture of a first attachment. The boys caught the\n",
      "youthful infection, and raced Tessie and me down the green slopes we had\n",
      "to traverse, until I told them they reminded me of Greenwich fair. Of\n",
      "all the company only two seemed unequal to taking part in the general\n",
      "hilarity. These two were Cave Charteris and _petite_ Ange.\n",
      "\n",
      "He walked along with his head in the air, without appearing to take much\n",
      "interest in the conversation of his self-elected companion. Did he or\n",
      "did he not care for the attentions which this woman was always pressing\n",
      "upon him? To love her I was quite sure would be impossible to him—the\n",
      "great difference in their ages alone would render it most unlikely—but\n",
      "he had certainly been more polite and amiable to her lately than he had\n",
      "ever been before.\n",
      "\n",
      "What motive could he have for it? for I was certain Cave Charter never\n",
      "did anything without a motive. Did he entertain any thoughts of marrying\n",
      "her? Miss Markham was reported at that time to have money, and Madame\n",
      "Marmoret had more than once openly expressed her disgust to see the\n",
      "lady’s favours transferred to the wrong quarter. But Mr. Charteris had\n",
      "told me he was rich; he could never be so mean as to sell his liberty to\n",
      "an old woman when he was not even in want of pecuniary assistance. Yet\n",
      "on what other grounds, except the desire to ingratiate himself with her,\n",
      "could one account for his former rudeness being changed to a curt\n",
      "familiarity? The other dullard of our party, dear Ange, was not so\n",
      "melancholy as she was silent. The burst of grief she had given way to,\n",
      "now more than a week ago, had been succeeded by an unusually subdued\n",
      "manner—an _older_ manner if I may express it so. It was as if the\n",
      "discovery of that day had swept her youth away before it. So I believed,\n",
      "at least, then—now I know that subtler influences were at work to\n",
      "destroy her gaiety.\n",
      "\n",
      "I tried on that morning, by every means in my power, to make Ange like\n",
      "her former self, but it was in vain. She laughed, it is true, and when\n",
      "we pulled her down the steep hills, the crimson blood mantled in her\n",
      "peachy cheeks and made her beautiful, but there was a sense of care\n",
      "underlying the laughter that spoilt the joyousness of its echo, and the\n",

      "healthy exercise.\n",

      "The grottoes we were about to visit extended for a great distance under\n",
      "the grounds of Monsieur de Condé, whose property they were, and who\n",
      "charged a certain sum for admission to them. They had been discovered by\n",
      "some workmen whilst excavating on his estate, and had been quite a\n",
      "source of profit to their owner ever since. The visitors to St. Pucelle,\n",
      "naturally, had already heard a great deal about these famous grottoes,\n",
      "and Sophy Markham ‘gushed’ over them to her heart’s content.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh! I am so _anxious_ to see them! I am anticipating so much pleasure\n",
      "from this little excursion!’ she exclaimed, with a violent and most\n",
      "palpable squeeze of Mr. Charteris’s arm. ‘I have been looking over the\n",
      "book in the hotel where visitors have written down their impressions of\n",
      "them, and they are so terribly tantalising. A Persian describes himself\n",
      "as having been suddenly transported into fairyland—didn’t he, Lizzie\n",
      "dear?—positively into fairyland, and says he can compare the vast\n",
      "caverns to nothing but the palace of his great master the sultan, and\n",
      "the forms of the stalactites to lovely houris frozen around him. Isn’t\n",
      "it poetical? _Frozen houris!_ Oh! I do love poetry so! It is the very\n",
      "life of my soul.’\n",

      "\n",
      "‘I’m afraid if you do not lessen your anticipations, Miss Markham, that\n",
      "you will be disappointed. I went over the grotto years ago with some\n",
      "friends, but I saw nothing at all like “frozen houris” there.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Ah! but then, my dear Tessie, you are not imaginative. Now, I _am_. I\n",
      "always have been, and it is my _métier_ to make the very best of\n",
      "everything I see. You don’t blame me for it, or think me foolish, Mr.\n",
      "Charteris, do you?’\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course Mr. Charteris assured her that folly and herself were the two\n",
      "things in his ideas farthest removed from one another, and just as he\n",
      "had given vent to this opinion, we came in sight of the mouth of the\n",
      "grotto, where two _guides_, each bearing a petroleum lamp, awaited our\n",
      "arrival. They tendered us little hats made of grey linen, each trimmed\n",
      "with a cockade and a bunch of red feathers in front, very much after the\n",
      "pattern of those adopted by the monkeys on the organs, and for which we\n",
      "were expected to exchange those we wore, which were liable to be damaged\n",
      "by the drippings from the cave.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were comical-looking head-dresses, and I hardly wondered at Mrs.\n",
      "Carolus and the fair Sophia hesitating to surmount their hard-lined and\n",
      "puckered faces by them, although Ange and Tessie looked all the prettier\n",
      "from the contrast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Markham in particular, I could see, would rather have spoiled a\n",
      "dozen hats than assumed the unbecoming linen one, had she not been\n",
      "ridiculed into doing so.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh! Lizzie dear, we never _can_ wear such things—now can we?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I’m sure I don’t know, dear. I’d much rather keep on my bonnet, but\n",
      "then it cost five guineas, and I shall be crazy if it gets hurt. I\n",
      "really think I must venture to try one of the caps.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh! my dear girl, you do look so comical! Excuse my laughing—but you’ve\n",
      "no idea—and grey never did suit your complexion, you know.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, I don’t think you need talk, Sophy. So plain a headdress is by no\n",
      "means suited to your own style of features, I can tell you!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh! the horrid thing—I will never, never wear it!’ cried the childish\n",
      "Sophia, as she threw the offending cap upon the ground; and I believe,\n",
      "if she had not overheard Mr. Charteris grumble at being kept waiting so\n",
      "long, that she would have been as good as her word.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, finding that we were all wearing them and she would be singular if\n",
      "she did not do the same, she consented at last to crown her _chignon_\n",
      "with it, and came simpering forth like a bashful girl that was afraid of\n",
      "being looked at.\n",
      "\n",
      "No one troubled her, however, and the whole party being ready, we began\n",
      "to descend the first flight of wooden steps which were steep but easy,\n",
      "and went down, down, down, until the ivy and fern covered entrance was\n",
      "left far above us, and we had reached the very centre of the cave, which\n",
      "was yet light enough to let us see that there were several more such\n",
      "flights to be descended before we could touch level earth again.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a fine opportunity for Miss Markham and Mrs. Carolus to shriek\n",
      "and laugh hysterically, and cling like grim death to whoever happened to\n",
      "be nearest to them, and they made every use of it. But Mr. Charteris and\n",
      "Mr. Carolus had been wise in their generation, and insisted upon going\n",
      "down first, leaving their women-kind to struggle in the rear with any\n",
      "one they could lay hold of. So poor Charlie and Arthur Thrale had them\n",
      "all to themselves, whilst Tessie and I laughed wickedly in each others’\n",
      "ears.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last we stood on level ground, in a cavern as dark as Erebus; there\n",
      "was no light anywhere, except from the lamps of the guides, who waved\n",
      "them over their heads and introduced us to _la grande salle_. I looked\n",
      "up and down and round about me; but all was black as pitch. I felt that\n",
      "I was standing on broken flints and thick mud, and as the guides’ lamps\n",
      "threw their faint gleam here and there, I perceived that the cave we\n",
      "stood in was very vast and damp, and uncommonly like a huge cellar, but\n",
      "I can’t say that I saw anything more.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Are these the “frozen houris?”’ asked Cave Charteris, sarcastically.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh no! I should hardly think so,’ replied Miss Markham, quickly;\n",
      "‘and—where are you, Mr. Charteris? I feel so dreadfully timid, I can’t\n",
      "tell you—and would give anything to have hold of the hand of some one\n",
      "that I knew!’\n",

      "‘All right! You can take my arm if you wish it. But we can’t walk\n",
      "abreast through the passages,’ he answered, with anything but lover-like\n",
      "alacrity, and something made me turn to Ange and whisper:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Are you not frightened, dear, too? If so, I can hold you up.’\n",
      "\n",
      "But she said calmly:\n",

      "In another minute the guides had turned and led us through a passage cut\n",
      "in the rock. We were not going up nor down stairs now, but picking our\n",
      "way over slippery stones, and between places sometimes so narrow and so\n",
      "low, that gaunt Mr. Carolus knocked his head more than once, as he\n",
      "disregarded the guides’ warning cry of ‘_Tête!_’ and the majority of us\n",
      "got bruised arms and shoulders. Every now and then we came upon a larger\n",
      "excavation which was called a _salle_, and bore some name consequent on\n",
      "the likeness assumed by the stalactites it contained. One was termed\n",
      "_Salle de Brahma_, because it held a lump of crystal somewhat resembling\n",
      "the idol of that name. Another _Salle du Sacrifice_, its principal\n",
      "attraction being a large flat stone, at the foot of which was another,\n",
      "shaped like a sausage and entitled _tombeau de la victime_.\n",
      "\n",
      "We paced after the guides through these cavernous passages for what\n",
      "appeared to me to be miles, my mind, meanwhile, being divided between\n",
      "fear that I should leave my best pair of boots behind me in the slushy\n",
      "clay, and apprehension as to the appearance my crape would present when\n",
      "I reached home again. I heard Mrs. Carolus, every now and then,\n",
      "querulously complaining to ‘Willy’ of the pains she was acquiring in her\n",
      "back from the constant stooping, and I knew that Sophy Markham was\n",
      "dogging Mr. Charteris’s steps as closely as the circumstances would\n",

      "uncomplaining.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was beginning to think that we had come on a very foolish expedition\n",
      "and were likely to have more pain than pleasure for our trouble, when I\n",

      "wet slippery stairs upon which it was most difficult to keep a footing,\n",
      "until we arrived at what was decidedly the finest sight there, the\n",
      "_Salle du Sabbat_. Here the guides proposed to send up a spirit balloon,\n",
      "in order to show us the height and extent of the vast cavern, and went\n",
      "away, taking the lamps with them, having first planted us in a row on\n",
      "the edge of a precipice, and conjured us not to stir until their return.\n",
      "I think we felt little inclination to do so. The blackness about us was\n",
      "so thick that we could almost _feel_ it, and the silence was that of\n",
      "death. Ange slipped her little hand in mine, and whispered:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Hilda, suppose they should never come back!’ and I could not say the\n",
      "supposition was a pleasant one. She had been standing between Sophy\n",
      "Markham and myself, but as she said the words, she slipped round my back\n",
      "and linked her arm in mine on the other side.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Markham, for a wonder, was silent, but Mrs. Carolus was plaintively\n",
      "trying to make her spouse partake her girlish fears, and he was\n",
      "ridiculing them with a kind of rough good sense that made me laugh.\n",
      "Under cover of their expostulations with one another, a mouth approached\n",
      "my ear on the side left vacant by Ange, and I heard a voice say gently:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘My own darling! How much I love you!’\n",
      "\n",
      "The announcement took me so completely by surprise, that, for the\n",
      "moment, I imagined it had proceeded from Charlie Sandilands, and it was\n",
      "quite a mercy that, under cover of the darkness, I did not turn round\n",
      "and smartly box his ears in return for his impudence. But before I had\n",
      "had time to prepare the weapon of chastisement, the speaker continued,\n",
      "still in the same soft tones:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What a nuisance it is having to play propriety before all these bores!\n",
      "How I long to be alone with you again, and able to tell you what I\n",
      "feel!’\n",
      "\n",
      "Before this sentence was concluded, I had recognised the voice as that\n",
      "of Cave Charteris, and was bristling with indignation.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What do you mean by speaking to me like that?’ I said angrily.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Good God, Hilda!’ he rejoined, ‘is it you?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes, it is I! Who did you take me for?’\n",
      "\n",

      "of what to say, ‘where is Miss Markham?’\n",
      "\n",
      "We had both raised our voices in our mutual surprise, and his last\n",
      "question was overheard.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Here I am, Mr. Charteris!’ ejaculated the fair Sophy, from his other\n",
      "side—I know she had shifted her quarters in hopes of extracting some\n",
      "familiarity from him before the lights came back. ‘Close to you—see!’\n",
      "\n",
      "The order to ‘see’ was apparently accompanied by a playful pinch, for\n",
      "Charteris gave a sudden yell, and a step forward that might have sent\n",
      "him over the precipice.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Do be careful, Miss Markham,’ I exclaimed, with an expression of\n",
      "annoyance, ‘and keep your facetiæ until we stand on safer ground. You\n",
      "might have caused Mr. Charteris to make a false step.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh, you needn’t be so alarmed, Miss Marsh,’ she answered meaningly; ‘I\n",
      "assure you I am quite as anxious for Mr. Charteris’s safety as you can\n",
      "be, and I should think you had quite enough to do to look after Mr.\n",

      "\n",
      "‘I don’t know what you mean,’ I retorted; but at that moment the spirit\n",
      "balloon rose in the air, and half a dozen voices joined in a chorus of\n",
      "admiration at the height and depth and length and breadth of the cavern\n",
      "we stood in, and the glittering clusters of stalactites which the light\n",
      "momentarily revealed as it majestically sailed past them. I looked with\n",
      "the rest, but my thoughts were far away from the scene around me. A\n",
      "question was puzzling my brain which I felt I could not give up until I\n",
      "had unravelled. _For whom_ had Cave Charteris intended the whisper which\n",
      "by mistake he addressed to me?\n",
      "\n",
      "It worried me all the way home, and long after I had reached it. His\n",
      "subsequent query seemed to imply that he had believed Sophy Markham\n",
      "stood next him, but I could not credit that he had said those words\n",
      "except with the intent to mislead me. Was it possible that he could have\n",
      "seriously called Miss Markham by such a term of endearment, or addressed\n",
      "her with so much earnestness in his voice? And if it were not possible,\n",
      "then—did he intend that speech for Ange, who would have been standing\n",
      "between us had she not slipped round to my other side at the very moment\n",
      "we were left in darkness?\n",
      "\n",
      "_Cave Charteris and Ange!_ The very combination of names seemed like\n",
      "sacrilege in my ears. The man who had made love to me, and left me in\n",
      "years gone by—who had tried to make love to me only a few weeks back—to\n",
      "have the happiness of that innocent trusting child in his hands! It was\n",
      "too horrible to think of. Whatever his protestations or passions for the\n",
      "moment might be, he was cold and cruel by nature. I could read it in his\n",
      "eyes and the sentiments in which he expressed his opinions, and I\n",
      "trembled to think what Ange’s fate might prove, if he aroused all her\n",
      "deepest feelings, and then basely deserted her as he had deserted me.\n",
      "What was I to do? What was it my duty to do—both towards her and him! If\n",
      "the sentences I heard were meant for Ange, it was not the first time Mr.\n",
      "Charteris had addressed her as a lover. That was evident.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Men don’t call women their ‘own’ until they have proved they are willing\n",
      "to be so. I knew enough of human nature to know that. And then he had\n",

      "whoever he spoke to had already kept appointments with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh! could it—could it be our little Ange? All my knowledge of her\n",

      "suspicion as an impossibility; but it was still more impossible to\n",
      "believe that Mr. Charteris had seriously addressed those lover-like\n",
      "speeches to old Sophy Markham. My mind became distracted in its\n",
      "ignorance what to think, and how to act. If he were making love to Ange,\n",
      "I felt as if, at all risk, I ought to fly to her rescue; but if he were\n",

      "had enjoyed our visit to his immortal grotto: and I had left Tessie and\n",
      "Ange ironing their father’s shirts in the kitchen. Mr. Charteris I was\n",
      "unable to account for, as he had left the house immediately after\n",
      "dinner, and was probably smoking the calumet of peace with his friend\n",

      "distinguish the red light as he blew the thin wreaths of smoke into the\n",
      "air; but that was no guide to his personality, since every man in St.\n",

      "second figure stepped out into the darkness.\n",
      "\n",

      "going on and encouraged it; and I stood in the despicable light of an\n",
      "eavesdropper and scandalmonger, who was actuated by jealousy to play the\n",
      "spy! I could have cried with vexation and indignation, and, indeed, for\n",

      "\n",
      "As I walked homewards by myself I wondered I had been so bold, but I\n",
      "would not have said one word less had the interview come over again. I\n",
      "read the old man’s selfishness at a glance. He was afraid of losing\n",
      "Charteris as a boarder and money-lender if he brought him to book for\n",

      "\n",
      "I was hurrying home, with my eyes on the ground and my thoughts all\n",
      "engrossed with the subject in hand, when I was attracted by a loud\n",
      "shouting and hallooing, and, looking up, perceived some one in front of\n",
      "me long and lanky, waving his arms round and round like a windmill.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Hollo, Miss Marsh! don’t you know me?’ he exclaimed; and then I\n",
      "recognised my youthful companion of the steamboat, Master Frederick\n",
      "Stephenson.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Why, Master Fred, is that really you?’ I said, as I shook hands with\n",
      "him. ‘I believe you have grown, even in the short time since I saw you.\n",
      "And does your cousin expect you? He said nothing to us about it.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Expect me! Not he, the scrubby fellow! He promised a dozen times that\n",
      "he’d ask me over here for a day’s shooting, and I’ve written almost\n",
      "every week to remind him, but ’twas no go. So I got old Felton to give\n",
      "me a holiday, and took French leave; and here I am, and if Cave don’t\n",
      "like it, he can do the other thing, for I don’t mean to go back till my\n",

      "you’ve got such a colour. You’re first rate, you are.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Am I?’ I said, hardly able to help laughing at the rough compliment,\n",
      "though I felt so sad. ‘I am glad you think so, Fred, for I would much\n",
      "rather look nice to my friends than nasty.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, you do look nice, then, and no mistake. And are both the Miss\n",
      "Lovetts at home?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I’m in luck, by George! won’t that beggar Charteris be surprised to see\n",
      "me walk in! I’d a mind to show him I was not going to be humbugged in\n",
      "that way. He thought he’d keep all the fun to himself, I suppose.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I am afraid you have not come on a shooting-day, at least I heard\n",
      "nothing about it this morning.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I don’t mind. I’d rather stay with you. Is that the house? It _is_\n",
      "pretty! Just like an old Swiss châlet. And, by the way, Miss Marsh, how\n",
      "do you get on with old Lovett?’ concluded the young gentleman, with a\n",
      "peculiar twinkle in his eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh! very well. How should I get on with him?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Isn’t he a good, pious, benevolent, amiable old gentleman, eh? Isn’t he\n",
      "self-denying, and prudent, and saving, and all that sort of thing?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Hold your tongue, sir,’ I replied, ‘and don’t speak in that way of your\n",
      "betters.’\n",
      "\n",
      "For all the windows and doors were open, and I had no wish that Tessie\n",
      "or Ange should overhear the remarks of my impudent young friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘My _betters_!’ reiterated Master Fred. ‘Oh! come now, Miss Marsh, do\n",
      "draw it mild.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I hope you are not going to indulge us with that sort of schoolboy\n",
      "slang all dinner-time, or you will shock the Miss Lovetts,’ I told him,\n",
      "‘and, if I am not much mistaken, you will offend your cousin also.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Ah! the elegant and accomplished Cave. Yes, I shouldn’t wonder if I\n",
      "did, and it would not be the first time either. But I see his cropped\n",
      "flaxen poll bobbing up at the window. By Jove! didn’t he look black when\n",
      "he caught sight of me! I’m in for it, Miss Marsh, and no mistake; but I\n",
      "rather like a row than otherwise. There’s so little excitement about\n",
      "here, that one’s digestion is ruined for want of it.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh! I hope you won’t have a row,’ I replied; but when we entered the\n",
      "_salle_, where Mr. Charteris was seated with the two girls, I was really\n",
      "afraid Master Fred’s prophecy would come true. I could not account for\n",
      "the extreme annoyance that clouded his cousin’s face at the sight of\n",
      "him. It could not have arisen simply from the fact of the boy having\n",
      "made his appearance without leave, and yet one would have thought he had\n",
      "committed the most serious offence by doing so.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, Cave, you don’t look over and above pleased to see me!’ exclaimed\n",
      "the lad, as soon as he had renewed his acquaintance with the Lovett\n",
      "girls.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I can’t say I am. Why didn’t you wait till I sent for you, instead of\n",
      "running over in this unceremonious fashion?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Wait till you sent for me! I fancy I might have waited till the crack\n",
      "of doom, in that case. Why, how much longer do you intend to remain here\n",
      "yourself?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I don’t know, and it’s no concern of yours,’ replied Charteris, with\n",
      "visible annoyance.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Of course not! You’re your own master, and the longer you stay away the\n",
      "better, at least for those at home.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Now, Fred, I don’t want any of your nonsense. Please to understand\n",
      "that.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I can’t give you sense if I haven’t got it. But my dad writes me word\n",
      "that they’ve a clean bill of health down at Parkhurst now, and that Mary\n",
      "is very anxious to see you back again.’\n",
      "\n",
      "If Charteris had been suddenly shot he could hardly have jumped up more\n",
      "quickly than he did at these words.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Fred, my boy!’ he exclaimed, with a total change of manner, ‘don’t you\n",
      "want to have a little shooting in the forest?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, of course I do, if it’s possible! But I didn’t expect to get it,\n",
      "as I came over without warning.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I should like to oblige you if I can, but if we are to do anything we\n",
      "must start at once. I left my guns up at the château, and we must call\n",
      "for them on our way. Are you game for a long walk, Fred?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Pretty well! but is there any such hurry?’ Can’t we get an hour or two\n",
      "after _goûter_? I’m no great shakes with a gun, you know, Cave—not a\n",
      "bigwig like you or the Baron—so that I dare say I shall have had enough\n",
      "of it long before you have. And I’m so hungry.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Bother your hunger! we can get something up at the château. If you want\n",
      "to shoot, say so; and if you don’t, you’d better go back to Rille, for\n",
      "there’s no other amusement for you at St. Pucelle.’\n",
      "\n",
      "I could not imagine why he should be so cross with the lad, and Tessie\n",
      "and Ange seemed as puzzled as myself. Fred Stephenson was nothing but a\n",
      "boy—troublesome, no doubt, and often saucy, as boys will be—but a frank,\n",
      "gentlemanly young fellow that no man need have been ashamed to own as a\n",
      "relation. As Mr. Charteris spoke to him in the rough way related, he\n",
      "stood silent for a moment, and then said with a kind of nervous laugh:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There’s evidently no room for me here, so perhaps I should be wiser to\n",
      "go back.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No, no!’ I urged; ‘stay and shoot. Mr. Charteris only wants you to make\n",
      "up your mind.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘If he’s got one!’ sneered his cousin.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Blowed if I haven’t got as big a one as you!’ exclaimed the lad; ‘and a\n",
      "better temper into the bargain. I’m sure I pity your people at home——’\n",
      "\n",
      "But before he could finish his sentence Charteris had turned on him with\n",
      "a face pale with passion.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Are you going to hold your tongue or not?’ he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I see no reason why I should.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Then I shall have to make you.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You’d better try!’\n",
      "\n",
      "Their conversation was so inevitably leading to a quarrel that I thought\n",
      "it time to interfere. I had no clue to the mystery that had raised Mr.\n",
      "Charteris’s temper, but I was sorry for Fred Stephenson, whom I could\n",
      "see was feeling all a boy’s disappointment at the prospect of having his\n",
      "holiday cut short. So I attempted the _rôle_ of peacemaker.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Mr. Charteris, pray don’t have any words with your cousin. You are\n",
      "frightening Ange and all of us. And, Fred, you shouldn’t speak in that\n",
      "way; you are spoiling your holiday, and making everybody uncomfortable.\n",
      "Mr. Charteris, won’t you take him to the forest?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘If he wishes it I will. I have already said so.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I am sure he wishes it. He only came over for that purpose; didn’t you,\n",
      "Fred?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I shan’t care to go if Charteris speaks to me in that manner,’ grumbled\n",
      "the boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I shall not do it if you keep a civil tongue in your head. Will you\n",
      "come out shooting, then, or not?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Very well; I shall be ready in half a minute.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Charteris turned on his heel as he spoke and left the room, but I\n",
      "detected an uncomfortable look of suspicion on his face as he did so.\n",
      "\n",
      "This unpleasant episode had made us all feel conscious, and not tended\n",
      "to increase the hilarity of my temperament. Fred stood thoughtfully at\n",
      "the window after his cousin had disappeared, and I drew near to speak a\n",
      "few words of comfort to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I am sorry this has happened, but it will all blow over in the forest.\n",
      "I suppose you will come back to dinner with him.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I don’t know. If I don’t get on his black books again, I may. What\n",
      "makes him so grumpy, Miss Marsh?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I have no idea! He seemed annoyed at your mentioning Parkhurst. Is that\n",
      "where his family live?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes! And you know it’s such a shame, he’s been away from home now for\n",
      "nearly six months, and of course it’s put them out, and my dad says it’s\n",
      "all a pretence his being afraid of the scarlet fever. Only two had it,\n",
      "and they were well weeks ago, and poor Mary——’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘That’s his sister, isn’t it?’ I interposed.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Cave Charteris re-entered the room at that very moment, and Fred did\n",
      "not answer my question. I was sorry for it, for I wanted to learn\n",
      "something about his cousin’s family, for Ange’s sake. But he was hurried\n",
      "off to the château, and there was no further opportunity to exchange a\n",
      "word with him. He departed with many _au revoirs_, promising himself to\n",
      "meet us again at dinner; but when that meal was served, to our great\n",
      "surprise Mr. Charteris walked in alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Where is your cousin?’ we simultaneously asked him.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘My cousin!’ he ejaculated, as if he had quite forgotten his existence.\n",
      "‘What! Fred Stephenson! I’ve sent him back to school by the diligence.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Without his dinner?’ said Tessie, in a voice of pity.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh! he had an excellent lunch at the Baron’s—ate enough for two, I can\n",
      "assure you; and I knew if I brought him back here that he would outstay\n",
      "his leave. Mr. Felton is very particular about the boys being punctual,\n",
      "and Master Fred is _not_ particular about anything at all; and so, as I\n",
      "am a sort of guardian of his, responsible to his father for his good\n",
      "behaviour and all that sort of thing, I thought it better to take the\n",
      "law into my own hands and see him safely off before I sat down to\n",
      "dinner.’\n",
      "\n",
      "It sounded plausible. There was no particular fault to find with the\n",
      "man’s anxiety to save his young cousin from getting into a scrape with\n",
      "his master, still, coupling it with the reception he had given the lad\n",
      "that morning, and the haste with which he had hurried him out of the\n",
      "house, I could not help suspecting that Cave Charteris had some other\n",

      "‘Why do you go up to the convent every morning, dear? It is far too long\n",
      "a walk for you.’\n",
      "\n",
      "I was standing in the little _salle_, holding Ange’s hot hand in my own.\n",
      "Six days had elapsed since Master Fred Stephenson had appeared and so\n",
      "mysteriously disappeared from amongst us, and on each one of them Ange\n",
      "had toiled up to the Convent des Petites Sœurs, which was situated on\n",
      "the brow of a hill, two miles on the road to Artois, and not come back\n",
      "again until it was time for dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believed that in her feverish and unsettled state of mind, and with\n",
      "her loose notions of theology, she was doing some sort of penance to\n",
      "satisfy her self-accusing conscience, and I so much wished that the dear\n",
      "child would open her mind to Tessie and me instead, and let us give her\n",
      "all the sisterly counsel in our power. But each day she seemed to shrink\n",
      "more and more from us, as well she might, whilst that man was persuading\n",
      "her to stain her fair soul with the blot of deceit.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there were other reasons for my trying to dissuade Ange from going\n",
      "to the convent. She was very far from well, or fit for the exertion.\n",
      "Whether it proceeded from mind or body, I could not tell, but since the\n",
      "day she had overheard Madame Marmoret’s speech to her father, in the\n",
      "courtyard, she had been quite unlike her former joyous, light-hearted\n",
      "self. Her cheeks were always either unnaturally flushed or unnaturally\n",
      "pale, she complained of a dull headache, and all the bounding elasticity\n",
      "I had so much admired seemed to have deserted her limbs. She was very\n",
      "particular about her religious services at this time, poor dear little\n",
      "Ange, spending an hour almost every evening in the church of St. Marie,\n",
      "and poring over her Bible long after Tessie and I had gone to rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, neither religion nor exercise and fresh air made any palpable\n",
      "difference in the appearance of the little maid, and I felt sure that\n",
      "something was very wrong. My expostulations on the subject with Tessie\n",
      "only brought to light another instance of Mr. Lovett’s selfishness. She\n",
      "looked very grave over the details of her sister’s symptoms, but was\n",
      "afraid to mention them to her father, because it would seem as though\n",
      "Ange required a doctor, and there was none nearer than Rille.\n",
      "\n",
      "He visited St. Pucelle once a week, and when he next came she would ask\n",
      "him to prescribe for Ange; but to send for him especially to visit her\n",
      "was to entail an expense which she was sure ‘dear papa’ could not\n",
      "afford. The time was past for disguising my sentiments in Tessie’s\n",
      "presence, and I told her plainly what I thought on this occasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet she was too timid to move in the matter. ‘Dear papa’ had evidently\n",
      "inspired her with so much wholesome dread of provoking his annoyance,\n",
      "that she preferred to shut her eyes to the fact of there being any\n",
      "danger in delay. But all this time I am standing in the inner _salle_\n",
      "with that little hot feverish hand in mine.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Why must you go to the convent, Ange?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There is no particular necessity, Hilda,’ she answered, yet she would\n",
      "not meet my eyes as she did so, ‘but it is a pleasure to me, and I feel\n",
      "as if I could not breathe in the house this weather. I know all the\n",
      "sisters well, and their parlours are so cool and pleasant. I feel like\n",
      "another creature inside the convent walls.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I hope you are not thinking of joining their community, Ange?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh no—oh no!’—with a vivid blush; ‘I am not good enough.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I don’t know about that, but we certainly can’t afford to lose you!\n",
      "However, if you are bent upon going this morning, may I go with you?’\n",
      "\n",
      "A startled look came into her eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Into the convent, do you mean?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No! not so far as that! Only to walk to the gates with you.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh! do, Hilda! I shall be very glad of your company. It is a lonely\n",
      "path over the hill.’\n",
      "\n",
      "So I was mistaken, after all, and had wronged the little maid in\n",
      "thinking that Mr. Charteris must be her cavalier on these occasions.\n",
      "\n",
      "We walked together through the blazing light over the fern covered hill,\n",
      "and conversed pleasantly on all the topics that interest young women\n",
      "most. Once I tried to sound her on the subject of Charteris, but she\n",
      "shrunk from it so visibly that I had not the heart to try again. It was\n",
      "as if I had plunged a surgeon’s probe into a bleeding wound.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I had kissed her pretty face for the last time, and left her behind\n",
      "the great iron grille of the convent, I could not help believing that my\n",
      "former supposition was correct, and Ange was brooding over the prospect\n",
      "of shutting herself up for ever within its walls. This idea worried me\n",
      "sadly. It would be like a living death for her!\n",
      "\n",
      "And what else but the burden of a committed wrong could have made Ange’s\n",
      "thoughts turn that way? Could she have discovered more of her father’s\n",
      "pecuniary affairs than Tessie and I knew of? and did the knowledge of\n",
      "disgrace and debt weigh her mind down to that extent that she longed to\n",
      "bury herself from the sight of the world? Or did the poor child imagine\n",
      "that the burthen of one less to keep and provide for would be of any\n",
      "substantial benefit to the family purse?\n",
      "\n",
      "These questions occupied my mind for half the way back again—until I\n",
      "came, indeed, upon a figure in a velveteen shooting-suit, stretched out\n",
      "at full length upon the thyme-scented grass, and lazily inhaling the\n",
      "light breeze that was wafted across the stream in the valley, and just\n",
      "lifted occasionally a curl of dark hair from his brow.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was that of my French master, Armand, Baron de Nesselrode.\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel I have reached a point when I must make a confession—namely, that\n",
      "since the memorable day upon which I was frightened by the dog-wolf on\n",
      "the Piron road, I had received more than one French lesson from the\n",
      "gentleman in question. I had never made a single appointment with him\n",
      "for the purpose; but he seemed to be ubiquitous, and to pop up wherever\n",
      "I went, so that although the verbs I mastered with him were\n",
      "_accidentals_, I had acquired quite a remarkable fluency in\n",
      "conversation, and never felt at a loss to express what I meant.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said I learned quicker than anybody he had known before; but I\n",
      "suppose, if ‘practice makes perfect,’ there was not so much credit due\n",
      "to me as he would have made me believe. Once I remember I stopped to ask\n",
      "myself if I were studying the French language so diligently _for\n",
      "Tessie’s sake_, and I was fain to answer ‘No.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, I am afraid that by this time Tessie’s interests had been\n",
      "withdrawn from the firm altogether. She was very stupid so I inwardly\n",
      "decided; she would not come forward and make the best of herself in the\n",
      "Baron’s presence, and in consequence it was impossible he could discover\n",
      "what a good wife he would gain in her, and so I had given them both up\n",
      "as a bad job.\n",
      "\n",
      "If people _wouldn’t_ find out what was best for themselves, it was\n",
      "useless wasting my time upon them. So Tessie’s merits had ceased to be\n",
      "dragged in by the head and shoulders, as a topic of conversation between\n",
      "Armand and me, and we only talked of such things as were most agreeable\n",
      "to ourselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, monsieur,’ I exclaimed, as I came up with him, ‘and what may you\n",
      "be doing here?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I followed you, mademoiselle.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘That is a pretty confession! How could you tell I had come this way?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I saw Mademoiselle Ange and you leave the curé’s house together.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And so you have been dogging our footsteps,’ I said, as I threw myself\n",
      "down on the grass he had just quitted.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Baron accepted my action as an invitation to resume his seat.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It is about time you accounted for yourself,’ I continued jestingly. ‘I\n",
      "don’t think we have seen you for two whole days.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Is it only two days?’ he said, in a melancholy voice. ‘It seems like\n",
      "two weeks to me.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Why, monsieur, what is the matter with you? Not moping again, I hope! I\n",
      "thought you promised me to be brave and keep your heart up, in hope of\n",
      "better times.’\n",
      "\n",
      "He sighed deeply.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘That was a week ago,’ he answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And what of that? You are talking mysteries to me.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Mademoiselle,’ said the Baron, suddenly changing the topic, ‘do you\n",
      "remember telling me the day we talked together on the road to Piron,\n",
      "that there is no “stooping” in honest labour?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I do.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I have thought much and earnestly of your words since then. I look back\n",
      "on the years that have passed since my great misfortune, and I see they\n",
      "have all been spent in idleness and waste of mind and body! I cannot\n",
      "recall them: they are gone and done for: they must be left to give their\n",
      "own account hereafter. But for the few that remain before I hope to take\n",
      "my station in society again I am determined, if possible, not to blush.\n",
      "I have made up my mind, mademoiselle. I am going to work.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I am sincerely glad to hear you say so!’ I exclaimed.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘If you are glad, it is all I ask. I will try to be glad also.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But what are you going to do?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I wrote to a friend at Court some weeks ago, telling him all, and\n",
      "asking his assistance to procure me fit employment until I should hold\n",
      "my own again. His answer arrived three days back. In it he offers me the\n",
      "post of _Ministre d’affaires_ in—in—Algiers.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘_Algiers!_’\n",
      "\n",
      "As I repeated the word after him, all the broad smiling landscape of\n",
      "hill and dale and stream which lay spread out before me seemed to be\n",
      "enveloped in a black mist that hid it from my view. A hoarse sound like\n",
      "the rushing of water was in my ears, and a horrid ‘whirring’ like wheels\n",
      "in my brain; then it all cleared off again. The sun broke out over the\n",
      "valley, my senses had returned; but I thought that the earth would never\n",
      "look the same to me again.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Do you not congratulate me?’ inquired Monsieur de Nesselrode, quietly.\n",
      "‘It is a charming climate, I understand, and the place is peopled with\n",
      "French. The salary is almost nominal, so are the duties; but the\n",
      "position is one that I can accept without blushing, and I shall, at all\n",
      "events, have an arena for work amongst my countrymen, small as it may\n",
      "be.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Does not the appointment meet your views for me? Will it not be better\n",
      "than dragging out four more years of idleness and false shame at the\n",
      "Château des Roses?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh yes.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I am not capable of much at present, you know, whatever I may be\n",
      "hereafter. You—in the goodness of your heart and friendship—may think me\n",
      "fit for a higher post, but I feel I am not. I have crippled my powers by\n",
      "nonusage: I must crawl now before I can fly. Perhaps, after a year or\n",
      "two, I may be fit for something better than the ministration of affairs\n",
      "in such a place as Algiers.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I am sure you will.’\n",
      "\n",
      "I was so angry with myself for not being able to say something better to\n",
      "him than this. I saw he wanted encouragement to take up this paltry\n",
      "appointment in a strange country. He had applied for it solely on my\n",
      "recommendation, and now that it had come, I had no words in which to\n",
      "praise and thank him for the compliment he had paid to my advice.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Algiers—a place so far removed from all his friends, and replete, as\n",
      "I ignorantly imagined, with dangers from climate and people—I did not\n",
      "expect that my counsel would have taken so unwelcome a form.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You do not congratulate me, mademoiselle,’ he repeated presently. ‘Do\n",
      "you not consider the prospect a good one?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh yes,’ I answered nervously; ‘very good indeed—that is, it is rather\n",
      "far from here, is it not, monsieur?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It is very far,’ he said gravely. ‘I do not suppose, when I have once\n",
      "left it, that I shall ever see St. Pucelle again; for the remembrances\n",
      "of the old château have no charm for me. A few weeks back, I would have\n",
      "declared myself ready to bear anything sooner than go to Algiers; but\n",
      "things that have come to my knowledge lately have made me think that the\n",
      "greater distance I put between myself and this place the better.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Have you any fresh trouble?’ I inquired anxiously, for he was my best\n",
      "friend in St. Pucelle, and I had come to be interested in all that\n",
      "befell him.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes, a very deep trouble!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What is it, monsieur? Will you not tell me?’\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned round upon his side, so that his face could look directly into\n",
      "mine.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘If I tell you, will you promise not to be angry with me, nor to feel\n",
      "less my friend than you do now?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I promise!’\n",
      "\n",
      "But there was an expression in his eyes that made me drop my own, I\n",
      "could not look at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Remember, before I speak, how much I wish you well. Hilde!’ (he had\n",
      "never called me by that name before), ‘if I could give you happiness by\n",
      "cutting off my right arm, I would do it at this moment. So that I am\n",
      "really and honestly glad to know that you are glad. The pain only is\n",
      "mine, _amie chérie_; and I can bear that bravely, so long as all is well\n",
      "with you.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Monsieur, I do not understand what you mean!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘When this appointment was first offered me, I thought I could not take\n",
      "it. I thought it would be impossible to leave St. Pucelle and you. But\n",
      "only a few hours afterwards I met Mademoiselle Markham, and she told me\n",
      "all about your _affaire de cœur_, and I was happy it should be so; only\n",
      "I felt I could not stay and see it.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What did she tell you?’ I asked quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘That you are _fiancée_ to Monsieur Sandilands. Ah, you need not blush,\n",
      "Hilde! It is all right if you wish it so. But for me it is better I\n",
      "should go to Algiers, and forget the pleasant times that we have spent\n",
      "together.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Armand!’ I said vehemently, ‘it is a lie! I am not _fiancée_ to Mr.\n",
      "Sandilands, nor to anybody.’\n",
      "\n",
      "How his face changed from quiet melancholy to radiant hope. The dullest\n",
      "eye might have interpreted that look.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What!’ he exclaimed. ‘You are free!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I _am_ free.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And you are sorry I am going to Algiers?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I _am_ sorry!’\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not know if there ever lived any women in this world (such as some\n",
      "novelists depict for us) who could cast away the whole of their lives’\n",
      "happiness for want of a single word to clear up a misunderstanding—but\n",
      "if so, I am not one of them. Armand de Nesselrode looked me full in the\n",
      "face as he put that question, and I should have been ashamed of myself,\n",
      "if I had not answered him truthfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Hilde!’ he said passionately, ‘will you go with me?’\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I felt that my woman’s victory was won, and I could afford to be\n",
      "silent and let silence speak for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I should not have dared to ask for this,’ he went on rapidly, ‘had it\n",
      "not been for the sweet encouragement your words have given me. You have\n",
      "told me that you despise wealth in comparison with love; that you rank a\n",
      "true heart and a strong arm above any earthly advantage, and that you\n",
      "think my honour still unstained. Will you take me, then, beloved Hilde,\n",
      "a poor man, disgraced in the eyes of the world, and with nothing to\n",
      "offer the woman he would make his wife, except a true affection and an\n",
      "earnest desire to prove himself worthy of hers? Oh, Hilde! do not keep\n",
      "me in suspense. I have loved you ever since the day you prayed for me in\n",
      "St. Marie?’\n",
      "\n",
      "I raised my eyes and looked at the dear face lifted so pleadingly to my\n",
      "own, and felt that nothing on this earth could repay me for the loss I\n",

      "\n",
      "‘Armand,’ I said tremblingly, ‘I must go with you to Algiers—because I\n",

      "I shall not write down here how he soothed me. Were I not my own\n",
      "biographer I might be able to tell it, but from the moment Armand said\n",
      "he loved me, our affection has been too sacred a thing for me to make\n",
      "public. In half an hour we were still sitting on that grass, chatting\n",
      "away as if we had been engaged for years, and making all sorts of plans\n",
      "for the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "I confided to him my money matters and Mr. Lovett’s strange dealings\n",

      "to liquidate it so that we might start free when we were married.\n",
      "\n",
      "And we mutually agreed not to say a word of what had passed between us\n",

      "\n",
      "‘Oh, how charming it was sitting in that lovely sunlight, and talking of\n",
      "the happy days to come! Algiers no longer seemed a horrid desert,\n",
      "situated a thousand leagues away from St. Pucelle. Our love had drawn it\n",
      "closer, and peopled it with pleasant forms and faces, until it looked\n",
      "like fairyland! I had but one regret amidst my pleasure: that my dear\n",
      "mother had not lived to see it! Bear witness for me, best beloved of\n",
      "parents, that you were not forgotten in your lonely grave in Norwood at\n",
      "that most ecstatic moment of my existence, for the tears ran down my\n",
      "cheeks as I recalled your love for me, and I told Armand what he had\n",
      "lost in never knowing it.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I will be thy mother and thy father and thy everything to thee,\n",

      "\n",
      "I had been hugging this dear delicious secret to my breast for the last\n",
      "three days; going apart at intervals to gaze upon it and assure myself\n",
      "that it was mine; and quite unable to believe in so much joy after the\n",
      "hopeless desolation of the last few months when that happened, which any\n",
      "one with discernment must have foreseen long ago, _petite_ Ange\n",
      "succumbed to the illness which had been hanging over her for weeks past.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was one morning when she had left the room as usual, _en route_ to\n",
      "her convent, and Mr. Lovett had set off on a round of what he called his\n",
      "parochial duties, that Tessie and I were startled by the sound of a loud\n",
      "clamour and confusion arising from the courtyard.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Good gracious!’ I exclaimed, as it struck my ears; ‘what on earth is\n",
      "that?’\n",
      "\n",
      "Tessie, who had turned as white as a sheet, would have detained me in\n",
      "the little _salle_, but I broke from her grasp, and rushing into the\n",
      "kitchen, looked through the open window. There I saw assembled in the\n",
      "court a group of about a dozen men and women, amongst whom I immediately\n",
      "distinguished the figures of Madame Marmoret, the Mère Fromard, and Jean\n",
      "Marat, who were all surrounding my reverend guardian and preventing his\n",
      "egress from his own domains. They had evidently waited to waylay him on\n",
      "his leaving the house, and were screeching or howling, according to\n",
      "their various sexes, as they made their fierce demands upon him for\n",
      "justice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mutiny was strongly marked on every countenance, and they pressed upon\n",
      "the old man as though they would lay violent hands upon him. Of course I\n",
      "guessed the reason of the uproar. It was the old story; they wanted\n",
      "their money, and he had none to give them! I glanced from the crowd\n",
      "towards my guardian, and for the first time I pitied him. He looked so\n",
      "pale and crestfallen as he leaned against the courtyard wall, fending\n",
      "off his creditors with the stick on which he supported himself. It was a\n",
      "sickening and humiliating spectacle, and I thanked Heaven in that moment\n",
      "that no blood of his ran in my veins.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Where are the twelve francs you owe me, monsieur?’ shouted Marat the\n",
      "cobbler. ‘I tell you I must have them. My wife is ill in bed, and\n",
      "requires broth and white bread to get up her strength again. Do you\n",
      "think I am going to let her want for lack of that which is my own? Hand\n",
      "them out, I say, for I will have them.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Bah!’ cried the scornful voice of Mère Fromard. ‘What is thy wife’s\n",
      "illness to him? Didn’t he steal my poor Guillaume’s money, and the\n",
      "little _dot_ I brought him on our marriage day? Five hundred and fifty\n",
      "francs, messieurs—every _sou_ owed us by that black-hearted old villain!\n",
      "and he let my husband die for want of bread and meat. I wish I could\n",

      "‘And much good you’d get out of his carcase, Mère Fromard!’ interposed\n",

      "the law must give us our rights!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Madame! Madame!’ said her master, in a mildly reproachful voice, ‘is it\n",

      "received in return? None! Not a _sou_—not a _centime_! I have gone on\n",
      "and on, because I knew if I left you I should get nothing, and you have\n",
      "promised and promised till I’m sick of the sound of your voice or the\n",
      "sight of your face. I should have summoned you before the _préfet_ and\n",
      "had my rights years ago if it hadn’t been for _la petite_ Ange, and you\n",
      "know it—_vaurien_ as you are—and have held the child as a threat over my\n",
      "head in consequence.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Down with him!’ shouted half a dozen voices; ‘down with the man who\n",
      "uses his own child as an instrument wherewith to scourge the poor, whom\n",
      "she is so good to! Don’t show him any pity! He has never shown any for\n",

      "Charteris been in the house, I should have summoned him at once to my\n",
      "assistance, but he had gone out shooting with Armand, and was miles and\n",
      "miles away. Mr. Lovett’s face was as pale and set as marble, but he\n",
      "continued in the same position and evinced no outward signs of fear.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Cannot you speak a little lower, my friends?’ he expostulated, in a\n",

      "complaints?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What do we care who hears us?’ replied the man in the blouse and the\n",
      "peaked cap, whose name was Dubois; ‘all St. Pucelle knows you to be a\n",
      "robber! The wider the truth is spread the better!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I know I owe you all some money,’ said Mr. Lovett, ‘and when I can pay\n",
      "you, I will. At present it is impossible, and you will get no good by\n",
      "keeping me a prisoner in my own yard. You had much better disperse\n",
      "quietly, and leave me in peace to see what arrangements I can make to\n",
      "satisfy you.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Aye—aye!’ responded Dubois, ‘leave you to go out and order in more\n",
      "champagne and burgundy, and truffled turkeys and smoked hams, for your\n",
      "own table, whilst we go home to feast on rye-bread and water. That’s\n",
      "what you’ve been doing for the last twenty years. Eating your head off\n",
      "on honest people’s credit, and giving them buttered words instead of\n",
      "cash. But you’ve come to the end of your tether at last.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘_Ahi! Ahi! Ahi!_’ yelled the rest, as they brandished their bare arms\n",
      "and made grimaces at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Truffled turkeys and champagne!’ screamed the Mère Fromard; ‘I’ll give\n",
      "him a truffled turkey to remember me by!’ and, seizing a huge wooden\n",
      "_sabot_ from her foot, she prepared to hurl it at his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a moment I had dashed through the kitchen-door, and was standing in\n",
      "front of the old man. My sudden and unexpected appearance created\n",
      "somewhat of a diversion.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘How dare you attempt violence!’ I cried excitedly; ‘put down that\n",
      "_sabot_, Mère Fromard, or I will send at once for the _gendarme_. You\n",
      "are fools, every one of you, to risk a prison for the sake of indulging\n",
      "your venomous tongues.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Mamselle does not understand,’ commenced the cobbler, with a view to\n",
      "explanation.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I understand everything, Jean Marat, and I see that you are a set of\n",
      "cowardly ruffians instead of respectable tradespeople as I took you to\n",
      "be. Twelve to one! That is a brave proceeding, isn’t it? Why, if you\n",
      "hadn’t watched Monsieur Charteris out of the house, you wouldn’t have\n",
      "dared to enter the yard.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We want our money, mamselle,’ squeaked a woman’s voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, you shan’t have it! not until you have apologised to Monsieur le\n",
      "Curé for the indignities you have put upon him, and gone quietly away to\n",
      "your own homes. If you will do that, I promise you your bills shall be\n",
      "paid.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Aye! but have you any right to promise?’ grumbled one of the men.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I have money of my own, and I will pay them myself. Will that satisfy\n",
      "you?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You may trust the word of mamselle,’ said Madame Fromard, addressing\n",
      "the crowd. ‘I know a true face when I see it, and she has been very good\n",
      "to me since Guillaume died.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And nicely you have requited my kindness, Madame Fromard,’ I retorted.\n",
      "‘You, who call yourself a Christian, to attempt to injure an old man\n",
      "like this, and a minister of religion. Are you not afraid of bringing\n",
      "down the anger of Heaven upon your family? What would Monsieur l’Abbé\n",
      "say to such a disgraceful proceeding?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Monsieur l’Abbé owes no man anything,’ grumbled the woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And because he is good, is that any reason you should be bad? I’m\n",
      "ashamed of the whole lot of you. Come now! clear out of this courtyard\n",
      "at once. If there is a single man or woman left here in two minutes’\n",
      "time, I shall send for the _gendarme_ to restore order. And you,\n",
      "Marmoret, go back to your kitchen and remain there!’\n",
      "\n",
      "I suppose my determined voice and manner had some effect in making them\n",
      "obey me, for they certainly disappeared with marvellous alacrity. But I\n",
      "was terribly frightened the while, and when the last one had filed out\n",
      "of the yard, I was trembling all over from excitement.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Mr. Lovett,’ I said quickly, as I turned to my guardian; ‘pray come\n",
      "back into the house. I am sure you must want a glass of wine after such\n",
      "an unpleasant scene.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The old man looked just the same as he had done before: very pale and\n",
      "fixed, but unmoved; and I could not help admiring his British\n",
      "determination not to show the white feather. Yet, when he answered me, I\n",
      "saw that his lip trembled, and I could hardly understand what he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Thank you, my dear Hilda,’ were his first words; and then I think he\n",
      "added, in a lower tone, ‘I have not deserved this at your hands.’\n",
      "\n",
      "We passed through the kitchen arm-in-arm, and I threw a defiant glance\n",
      "at Madame Marmoret, in exchange for the scowl with which she honoured\n",
      "me, and led my guardian to the little _salle_, where Tessie, who had\n",
      "nearly frightened herself into a fit, was waiting to receive us.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh, papa! dear papa!’ she exclaimed, as she flung herself into her\n",
      "father’s arms and burst into tears. ‘What _shall_ we do? Are those\n",
      "horrid people gone? Is there nothing we can say to keep them quiet?’\n",
      "\n",
      "But Mr. Lovett had quite recovered himself by this time, and was ready\n",
      "to rebuke his daughter for her folly in making a mountain out of a\n",
      "mole-hill.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Calm yourself, my dear Tessie,’ he said, as he patted her on the back;\n",
      "‘there is nothing to be so agitated about. These poor souls are\n",
      "certainly very ignorant of etiquette, and we must make allowances for\n",
      "them, although they must be taught that they cannot take the law in\n",
      "their own hands. They appear to have a little misunderstanding amongst\n",
      "them, and to fancy I do not intend to pay them their money. I must set\n",
      "this straight at once, and for that purpose I think it will be better if\n",
      "I go to Rille for a few days and consult my man of business, Monsieur\n",
      "Richet. Let me see, to-day is Tuesday, and I shall be back, at the\n",
      "latest, on Friday. Will you put a couple of shirts into my small black\n",
      "bag, my dear, and anything else you may think necessary, whilst our dear\n",
      "Hilda pours me out a glass of burgundy, for I really require something\n",
      "after all that talking.’\n",
      "\n",
      "I had not been his ‘dear Hilda’ for many a long day, but I was in no\n",
      "frame of mind to resent the liberty then. My reverend guardian’s\n",
      "coolness took me completely aback. Did he think that Tessie and I were\n",
      "to be gulled by his proposals to see his man of business, or had he\n",
      "talked in that pompous manner so long that he had outgrown the\n",
      "perception of its absurdity? At any rate, however, I was thankful he was\n",
      "going to Rille. To get him out of the way for the present was the chief\n",
      "thing, and whilst there, we might come to some conclusion as to the best\n",
      "way to patch up his affairs, which were so evident a scandal in the\n",
      "parish.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Let us walk with your father to the diligence, Tessie,’ I suggested, as\n",
      "she reappeared with his travelling-bag, for I felt quite afraid lest\n",
      "something might happen in the middle of the town if he were allowed to\n",
      "go by himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every one was agreeable to this arrangement, so we accompanied him as\n",
      "far as the Hôtel d’Etoile, and saw him safely seated in the coach and\n",
      "started on the road to Artois. And then we returned home again, I\n",
      "exhorting Tessie all the way to try and control her feelings, and keep\n",
      "her own counsel with respect to the morning’s alarm, lest some report of\n",
      "it should reach the ears of Ange.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we arrived at the house we ran upstairs together to make the beds,\n",
      "a domestic duty which we had taken upon ourselves and should have\n",
      "accomplished directly after breakfast had it not been for the\n",
      "unfortunate interruption to which we had been subjected. The first room\n",
      "we entered was that occupied by Ange and Tessie. The first thing I saw\n",
      "on entering it was a black heap upon the floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Hullo!’ I exclaimed, thinking it was a fallen dress, and about to\n",
      "reprimand the Miss Lovetts for their untidiness; but the next moment my\n",
      "voice had changed to a shrill alarm. ‘Tessie, Tessie! look here—for\n",
      "God’s sake! _it is Ange!_’\n",
      "\n",
      "We rushed up to the figure on the floor and knelt beside it. I raised\n",
      "the head and laid it gently back upon my arm. The girl was in a state of\n",
      "complete unconsciousness.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘She has fainted!’ cried Tessie. ‘Oh, my poor darling, how ill she\n",
      "looks! And how did she come here? I thought she had gone to the\n",
      "convent.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘So did I! She certainly said good-bye to us as she left the _salle_.\n",
      "Can she have felt ill and returned whilst we were absent?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But then Marmoret would have seen her, Hilda. The door of the corridor\n",
      "is locked; I have the key in my pocket.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, we mustn’t stay to speculate how it happened. Put a pillow under\n",
      "her head, Tessie. We must lay her flat down on the ground and loosen her\n",
      "clothes. Oh! how I wish you had sent for Dr. Perrin when I asked you.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘How could I tell she was so ill?’ asked Tessie, weeping.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Any one could have told it! She has been ill and feverish for weeks\n",
      "past, and I am not sure if her mind or body are suffering the most. What\n",
      "a pity we didn’t find her before your father left the house. He might\n",
      "have sent Monsieur Perrin back from Rille at once.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We must write and tell him by this afternoon’s post, Hilda. Oh! why\n",
      "doesn’t she open her eyes? What shall we do?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Set the door and window wide open, and run down and fetch some spring\n",
      "water to sprinkle her face with. Don’t cry so, Tessie; it can do no\n",
      "good, and will distress her when she is coming to herself again.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Tessie flew downstairs to do my bidding, and returned in company with\n",
      "Madame Marmoret, to whom she had confided her sister’s condition. To see\n",
      "that woman as she bent over the insensible form of her nursling, with\n",
      "all the rancour faded out of her black eyes, and her hard-lined, brown\n",
      "face twitching with emotion, one would never have believed she was the\n",
      "same creature who had urged on her master’s creditors to take their\n",
      "vengeance with the malignity of a she-devil.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘_Eh! bah! ma petite Ange!_’ she exclaimed, in a tone of anguish, as she\n",
      "kissed the unconscious face. ‘What art thou dreaming of? It is not time\n",
      "to go to heaven yet, _bébé_, though thou art fitter for that than for\n",
      "such an earth as ours. What can have brought thee to such a state,\n",
      "_enfant chérie_? _Ay mi, ay mi!_’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It is my belief you have only yourself to thank for it, Madame,’ I said\n",
      "curtly, as I unceremoniously thrust her to one side.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Does mamselle wish to insult me?’ she demanded.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I wish to tell you the truth. I believe that Mademoiselle Ange never\n",
      "went to the convent at all this morning, but came up to her room\n",
      "instead, and then overheard the disgraceful tumult you permitted in the\n",
      "courtyard. You may fancy how that would affect her when she has been\n",
      "kept in ignorance even of her father’s debts.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘_Mon Dieu!_’ cried Madame, aghast. ‘You do not mean to tell me the\n",
      "child was _here_ the while?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I feel sure she was. She could not have left the house and returned to\n",
      "it without our notice. We forgot all about her in our excitement, while\n",
      "she stood here and received a sword in her tender little heart. Poor\n",
      "Ange!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh, my _bébé_, my _bébé_!’ said Madame, with the tears running down her\n",
      "cheeks; ‘it is not true—it cannot be true! For nineteen years have I\n",
      "borne it patiently for her sake, and would have bitten my tongue out\n",
      "sooner than have told her what I suffered. And now, through my own\n",
      "wickedness, in an evil moment, she has heard all!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Hush!’ I exclaimed authoritatively. ‘She is coming to herself. Don’t\n",
      "make her worse by the sight of your agitation.’\n",
      "\n",
      "As I spoke the words, Ange slowly unclosed her violet eyes—dimmed\n",
      "violets they looked now, as if a cloudy mist had spread over them—and\n",
      "turned them inquiringly upon me.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It is all right, darling,’ I said cheerfully, to reassure her. ‘You\n",
      "have been a stupid girl and fainted, but now that you have revived\n",
      "again, we will lift you on the bed, and let you lie still and rest’\n",
      "\n",
      "We all three raised her as I concluded, and helped to lay her on her\n",
      "bed, but the only sign of consciousness she gave was the visible shudder\n",
      "with which she greeted Madame Marmoret’s touch.\n",
      "\n",
      "The woman stooped down and kissed her hand, but I saw Ange draw it\n",
      "away—very feebly it is true, but sufficiently to mark her dislike of the\n",
      "action—and then I knew that I had guessed aright, and she had been\n",
      "witness to the indignities heaped upon her father.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Hilda,’ said Tessie to me that afternoon, in a frightened whisper, ‘we\n",
      "_must_ write for Dr. Perrin.’\n",
      "\n",
      "I quite agreed with her; for though four hours had gone by since we had\n",
      "laid Ange upon her bed, she had not spoken a single word to either of\n",
      "us; and, except that her eyes were open, and she occasionally heaved a\n",
      "deep sigh, she appeared almost as unconscious as when we found her on\n",
      "the floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had not left her for a moment since that time, but had been unable to\n",
      "persuade her either to speak or swallow nourishment; and I, for one, was\n",
      "becoming seriously alarmed.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We must not only send for the doctor, but your father must come home\n",
      "again, Tessie,’ I answered, ‘for I am afraid that Ange is going to be\n",
      "very ill. If you will write the letter at once, I will run down with it\n",

      "\n",
      "I don’t know how it was, but at that moment I hated the thought of Cave\n",

      "Some people might imagine that in an emergency Madame Marmoret, being\n",

      "the age of Sophy Markham? But you know how ridiculous she makes herself,\n",
      "and the absurd notions she gets into her head, and I suppose she was\n",
      "really persuaded that the man liked her and so forth, and now she says\n",
      "that he has blighted her whole life, and she can never be happy again.’\n",

      "curiously. ‘This beats everything! But you may rely on the truth of my\n",

      "Mary Ferrier, a great heiress, and they have a beautiful place called\n",
      "Parkhurst in Devonshire, and two children, and they’ve all had the\n",

      "go home. Shabby of him, _I_ call it, to desert his family in an\n",
      "extremity like that; but men are all selfish, my dear. Yet why he should\n",

      "\n",

      "‘Home—home!’ I cried, as I commenced to run up the hill. ‘Don’t try to\n",

      "laid her down again, and she never uttered a syllable, but only stared\n",
      "at me with those melancholy wide-open eyes. I hurried Miss Markham out\n",
      "of the room, although I knew nothing of what you have now told me, and\n",

      "\n",
      "‘Certainly, she can see nobody. She is in a strong fever, and confined\n",

      "you would see that——’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I _do_ know all!’ I interrupted him sternly, ‘and a great deal more\n",
      "than you have any idea of. I know that you are a married man, and that\n",
      "you had much better be at home with your wife and children than\n",
      "affecting this interest in a girl who can never be anything to you\n",

      "\n",
      "‘What is that to you?’ I replied angrily; ‘if you are an honest man, why\n",
      "should you be ashamed to tell the world that you are a married one? I\n",
      "refuse to inform you if Ange has heard the truth or not, but you may\n",
      "rest assured that she will not hear it from you. Her father will be home\n",
      "to-morrow, and the first thing I shall do will be to caution him to\n",
      "protect the interests of his daughter!’\n",

      "\n",
      "‘You are shooting very wide of the mark,’ he replied, with an attempt at\n",
      "nonchalance, ‘and, forgive me for adding, talking of what you know\n",
      "nothing. I am not in the habit of confiding the details of my domestic\n",
      "life to everybody I meet in this world, but had the fact of my marriage\n",
      "been likely to affect Mr. Lovett or his daughters, I should certainly\n",
      "have announced it. Since you refuse to gratify my curiosity any further,\n",
      "may I ask to see Miss Lovett?’\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "‘You can do as you choose about that,’ I said, as I left him standing\n",
      "there and took my way upstairs again.\n",
      "\n",
      "In another minute he had passed into the street and was on his road, as\n",
      "I concluded, to the Hôtel d’Etoile, where he had been in the habit of\n",
      "spending his evenings since Armand had given up playing cards; and\n",
      "Madame Marmoret informed me that he did not return to the house that\n",
      "night.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a sad and anxious vigil that we spent beside the bedside of poor\n",
      "Ange, who, towards the small hours, began to toss her arms and head\n",
      "about and mutter rapid incoherent words of which we could not catch the\n",
      "import.\n",
      "\n",
      "As morning dawned, she lay more quiet, but the cruel fever still raged\n",
      "on, and she was very, very weak.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘How soon can the doctor arrive, Tessie?’ I inquired, as we met over a\n",
      "melancholy breakfast at a side-table in the kitchen. ‘When does the\n",

      "\n",
      "‘At eleven o’clock, Hilda. It is the only one, you know, so they are\n",

      "papa at home once more!’\n",
      "\n",
      "We sat together, anxiously waiting the advent of the diligence, and\n",
      "scarcely daring to make a surmise as to the probable issue of the\n",
      "doctor’s verdict on our poor little sister’s case.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eleven o’clock struck! Half-past eleven, and then there was a sound of\n",
      "feet in the _salle_ below. I did not stop to let Madame Marmoret\n",
      "announce any names, but flew past her on the stairs and into the room.\n",
      "Neither Monsieur Perrin nor Mr. Lovett awaited me there. The new arrival\n",
      "was Mr. Warrington. In my astonishment at seeing him, I forgot for a\n",
      "moment the absence of the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Why! Mr. Warrington! You are the last person in the world I expected to\n",
      "see.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And yet I sent Miss Hilda notice of my intended visit,’ he answered,\n",
      "shaking hands with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘True! but not of the probable time. However, I am very glad you are\n",
      "come. If I needed your advice when I wrote to you, I want it tenfold\n",
      "more now. I am in a sad tangle and perplexity, Mr. Warrington.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Sorry to hear that! I must have a long talk with your trustee about\n",
      "your financial concerns. I have come over for no other purpose. Do you\n",
      "wish your money to remain invested as it is at present?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No, I think not. The fact is, Mr. Warrington, I—I—(I have not told the\n",
      "Lovetts yet, as it is no concern of theirs) but—I am engaged to be\n",
      "married.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Hallo! That is sharp work, Miss Hilda. Not to a foreigner, I hope!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Now, Mr. Warrington, I thought you would be above such vulgar\n",
      "prejudice. He _is_ a foreigner—Baron Armand de Nesselrode—but he is\n",
      "better than all the Englishmen put together.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh! that of course. And do you intend to settle your income upon this\n",
      "gentlemen, then?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I have not decided that yet; but I do want to have it transferred to my\n",
      "own keeping. And oh! Mr. Warrington, you will have to pay a few debts of\n",
      "Mr. Lovett’s out of it too, because I promised the poor people I would\n",
      "be responsible for their money.’\n",
      "\n",
      "At this announcement the solicitor looked grave.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We must speak further on that subject, Miss Hilda. I can do nothing in\n",
      "a hurry. Where is Mr. Lovett, and how soon shall I be able to see him?’\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I remembered that my guardian ought to have arrived with the doctor\n",
      "from Rille by the same conveyance as Mr. Warrington had travelled in.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Why, he was at Rille, and didn’t he come with you in the diligence?’ I\n",
      "exclaimed hastily. ‘An old man with white hair and very blue eyes, and\n",
      "accompanied by a foreign doctor?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No; there were no gentry at all in the diligence. Only a few peasants\n",
      "and a sister of mercy.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What can have delayed them?’ I said, in distress. ‘We are in great\n",
      "trouble here to-day, Mr. Warrington. The youngest Miss Lovett was taken\n",
      "ill yesterday, and we have no medical assistance nearer than Rille. I\n",
      "wrote to her father by last night’s post, begging him to return this\n",
      "morning and bring a doctor with him, and I cannot imagine what should\n",
      "have prevented their arrival. What shall we do?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Is the case serious, then?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I fear it is—very serious!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Can I do nothing to help you, Miss Hilda?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Nothing, thank you, Mr. Warrington! We can but watch her and wait. Are\n",
      "you staying at the Etoile?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No, at the Cloche. The other looked too noisy for me. I will say\n",
      "good-bye now, then, as you are busy, and you must let me know as soon as\n",
      "Mr. Lovett returns.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I will—good-bye!’\n",
      "\n",
      "I was so glad to see the last of the dear little man who looked as\n",
      "dapper as if he had travelled up from London in a sealed envelope, for\n",
      "my mind was too much occupied to attend to him. As soon as ever his back\n",
      "was turned, I flew to Tessie to speculate on what unforeseen accident\n",
      "could possibly have occurred to prevent her father joining us.\n",
      "\n",
      "But speculation was of no use. We were utterly helpless. Wringing our\n",
      "hands would not abate one breath of the dreadful fever that was burning\n",
      "in Ange’s veins. All we could do was to pray to God.\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame Marmoret had spread the news through St. Pucelle, and many a poor\n",
      "peasant woman came up that afternoon and pleaded for admission, only\n",
      "just to look upon the face of _petite_ Ange. But I would let no one pass\n",
      "the threshold of her door, for her delirium was now at its height, and\n",
      "she talked continually.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tessie, who had no stamina, looked worn out with one night’s watching;\n",
      "and I persuaded her to go to my room and sleep, whilst I sat with her\n",

      "and I had to call up all my dearest thoughts of Armand, and to try and\n",
      "look steadily forward to the future that was opening for me, in order to\n",
      "keep my courage up to the sticking-point.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I do not believe it,’ Ange muttered rapidly—‘I do not believe it. I\n",
      "cannot believe it! He is _not_ married. Well, then, I will ask him\n",
      "myself. Where is he? At the Hôtel d’Etoile. I will go at once and ask\n",
      "him. It is but a step. What do my bare feet signify! I do not feel the\n",
      "stones. I only want to ask Cave if he is married. Yes, yes, I will go at\n",
      "once!’ and in a moment she was half out of bed, with her fevered feet\n",
      "upon the floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Dear, _dear_ Ange!’ I expostulated with her. ‘Get into bed again! Where\n",
      "would you go to, my darling? You are not dressed. You cannot leave the\n",
      "room. You must lie down like a good child and go to sleep.’\n",
      "\n",
      "She stared at me as if I had been a stranger.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Who is it? Why would you keep me? I do not mind the cold. I must go to\n",
      "the Hôtel d’Etoile. Sophy says he is there every evening, and perhaps he\n",
      "is waiting for me. He used to be angry sometimes because I did not go to\n",
      "meet him; but I was afraid papa would hear of it. And papa is so good!\n",
      "Oh, he is so good! so good! He is like a bright saint from heaven. Do\n",
      "you believe he would do anybody a wrong? If people tell lies, that is\n",
      "not his fault. He has a glory round his head. Now it is a rainbow\n",
      "bridge, stretching right into heaven! Let me climb up it—up—up—up—till\n",
      "we go through the shining gates together! But there is such a pain in my\n",
      "head! It dazzles me to look at them.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Lie down, my darling Ange! and let me bathe your poor head with this\n",
      "cold water.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh, sister Celeste, is it you? I have not finished the priest’s\n",
      "vestment yet, _ma sœur_. There are so many stitches in it, and the gold\n",
      "thread sparkles so, it makes my head ache. But I shall finish it soon!\n",
      "very, very soon! and then dear papa shall pay Cave the hundred and\n",
      "twenty-five francs he owes him. They will give me all that, will they\n",
      "not, _ma sœur_—and perhaps more? Yes, yes; I know—you said so; and then\n",
      "Cave shall have one hundred and twenty-five francs—one hundred and\n",
      "twenty-five francs—one hundred and twenty-five francs! Oh, don’t ask me\n",
      "to count them over any more! They shine so, they make my head ache!’\n",
      "\n",
      "So this was the secret of the little maid’s daily visits to the convent.\n",
      "She had been assisting the nuns in the embroidery orders they executed\n",
      "for the church, with the intention of paying back to Cave Charteris the\n",
      "money her father had borrowed from him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sweet, tender, self-denying little heart! Had it broken in the effort to\n",
      "sacrifice itself?\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh, Cave!’ she screamed suddenly, as the fever made a fiercer grasp\n",
      "upon her brain, ‘tell me you are _not_ married! You cannot be! It is\n",
      "impossible, because you love me so! And you are going to tell papa! You\n",
      "have promised me that you will tell papa directly you receive that\n",
      "letter from England. Why can’t you tell him now? Is he busy? Who are\n",
      "those people in the yard? How fierce and strange their faces look! Do\n",
      "they want to kill him? Oh, Cave, save my father! save my poor father!\n",
      "Look at all the wolves round him! Save him from the wolves!’\n",
      "\n",
      "She was becoming so terribly excited, that I was obliged to hold her\n",
      "down in her bed by main force.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Down, down!’ I heard her mutter. ‘Look at the gold pressing me\n",
      "down—till I sink into the earth! Napoleons—bright yellow Napoleons! How\n",
      "nice and cool they feel! but they are very heavy—much too heavy for me!\n",
      "I am not very old, you see. I was eighteen on the day I had those silver\n",
      "earrings you like so much—and you are thirty! How can you love me when I\n",
      "am so much younger than yourself? Yet you do, don’t you? You have sworn\n",
      "it so many times! Oh yes, yes; I understand. You needn’t be afraid. I\n",
      "shan’t tell Hilda!’\n",
      "\n",
      "The fever was running so high, and the dear child was becoming so\n",
      "violent, that I felt desperate. What could I do to quiet her? I had a\n",
      "bottle of laudanum in my room that I kept in the event of toothache, and\n",
      "I poured twenty or thirty drops of it in a little water, and gave it her\n",
      "to drink.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rightly or wrongly done, it had the effect of making her doze off for an\n",
      "hour, during which time I sat with bated breath and folded hands, lest I\n",
      "should disturb the charm.\n",
      "\n",
      "At seven o’clock Tessie crawled into the room again, looking like a\n",
      "washed-out rag. She seemed as if she wanted almost as much care as her\n",
      "sister, although I do not believe she at all realised the danger Ange\n",
      "was in.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh, I am so weary!’ were the first words she said to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I see you are. Well, look here, Tessie: I am going downstairs now to\n",
      "make you a good strong cup of coffee, and then I shall lie down till\n",
      "twelve o’clock, when you must come and call me again.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh, that won’t be fair, Hilda! You sat up all last night.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Never mind! I am stronger than you are, and a few hours’ rest will make\n",
      "me quite fresh. Ange is sleeping quietly now, and I hope she may\n",
      "continue to do so. But, at any rate, you are to wake me at twelve.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Notwithstanding my boasted strength, however, I was very glad to close\n",
      "my eyes in sleep; for to hold a night’s vigil is very trying when one is\n",
      "unaccustomed to it. But I have always possessed the ability to wake\n",
      "myself at any given hour. I lay down that evening, expecting to be\n",
      "roused at midnight: and at midnight I roused myself, without giving any\n",
      "one the trouble to call me. I waked in the darkness, struck a match, and\n",
      "perceived the hands of my little clock stood at fifteen minutes past the\n",
      "hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Just like Tessie!’ I thought. ‘She thinks to cheat me into snoring till\n",
      "six o’clock in the morning. But I am one too many for her!’\n",
      "\n",
      "I lit my candle, slipped on the shoes, which were the only articles of\n",
      "dress I had disencumbered myself of, and stole noiselessly across the\n",
      "corridor into the sisters’ room.\n",
      "\n",
      "How quietly Ange must be sleeping! There was not a sound but her\n",
      "breathing to be heard. Surely she must be better! The room was wrapt in\n",
      "gloom; it was foolish of Tessie not to have procured a lamp. I threw the\n",
      "light of my taper across the bed. The first thing I perceived was the\n",
      "form of Tessie, seated on the ground, with her head against the\n",
      "counterpane, and fast asleep. The words of Scripture flashed across my\n",
      "mind, ‘Could ye not watch one hour?’ But I excused her.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Poor girl,’ I thought, ‘she is really weak! It is a physical\n",
      "impossibility for her to keep awake.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The next moment I had thrown my light _upon_ the bed to see how Ange\n",
      "fared.\n",
      "\n",
      "Merciful heavens! _Where was she?_ I rushed up to the couch and pulled\n",
      "down the clothes impetuously. It was empty—void!\n",
      "\n",
      "I glanced round the room: it was in the same condition. _Ange was gone!_\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Tessie, Tessie!’ I exclaimed loudly, as I shook that young lady into\n",
      "consciousness again. ‘Where is your sister? Where is Ange?’\n",
      "\n",
      "She waked with a start of bewilderment, and became as horrified as\n",
      "myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But she was _here_—she was _here_!’ she kept on repeating. ‘I only went\n",
      "to sleep for a minute, indeed, Hilda! I left her sleeping safely here.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I believe it; but while you slept she has escaped. We must search every\n",
      "corner of the house at once. Come with me! there is not a moment to\n",
      "lose!’\n",
      "\n",
      "We rushed from room to room without success. Ange was apparently nowhere\n",
      "on the premises. I clasped my hands upon my forehead to try and decide\n",
      "what to do next. Escaped! and in the middle of the night! Where could\n",
      "she have gone to? Where could she _wish_ to go? I had it! Like an\n",
      "inspiration the answer came to me: ‘To the Hôtel d’Etoile!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Tessie!’ I cried, ‘you must stay here, in case Ange returns. Go and\n",
      "wake Madame Marmoret to keep you company. And I will go and search for\n",
      "her in the town.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘_In the town!_ Oh, Hilda, how could she be in the town? It is\n",
      "impossible!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Find her in the house then!’ I exclaimed, as I ran out of the front\n",
      "door, which was never fastened, night nor day, and flew down the steep\n",
      "stony street, in the direction of the Hôtel d’Etoile, as fast as my feet\n",
      "could carry me.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the principal hotel in the place, and boasted of a billiard-room,\n",
      "which was on the ground-floor and fronted the street. The young men in\n",
      "St. Pucelle made this billiard-room their nightly rendezvous: and it was\n",
      "here that Sophy Markham had averred that Charteris spent all his\n",
      "evenings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Long before I reached it I could see the stream of light which its lamps\n",
      "threw across the road, and hear the sound of men’s voices, laughing and\n",
      "talking together, and the click of the billiard-balls cannoning each\n",
      "other on the table. I felt sure it was here that Ange’s delirious fancy\n",
      "would lead her, and I was right. As I arrived opposite the open window\n",
      "of the billiard-room, I caught sight of a dark figure half hidden in the\n",
      "shadow of the wall, and springing towards it, I clasped her in my\n",
      "arms—Ange, with only her black dress covering her nightgown, her\n",
      "bronze-coloured hair floating over her shoulders, and her poor naked\n",
      "feet upon the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Ange! Ange! my darling!’ I exclaimed, as I folded her to my heart.\n",
      "‘Come back! Come home with me! You will be so ill if you remain here!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘_Hush! Hark!_’ she said, with such wide-open, fixed and solemn eyes,\n",
      "and in such a tone of awe, that I felt constrained to obey her.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were perhaps a dozen men or more, knocking the billiard-balls\n",
      "about and filling the atmosphere with smoke, but Cave Charteris’s voice\n",
      "was to be distinguished above them all.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Reckless old dog, that _Papa_ Lovett,’ I heard him say. ‘He’s a regular\n",
      "out-and-out swindler! I’ve lent him more cash myself since I’ve been\n",
      "here than his whole carcase would pay for, but I knew I should never see\n",
      "the colour of it again when I parted with it.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Took the change out in other ways, I suppose, _mon cher_?’ suggested a\n",
      "foreigner. ‘The _bon papa_ has two pretty daughters, _n’est ce pas_? and\n",
      "it is said you have evinced a decided predilection for the little one.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘_Ah! fi donc_, monsieur!’ cried Charteris, jestingly; ‘don’t make\n",
      "profane remarks! I am a married man! and other men’s pretty daughters\n",
      "are of no further use to me.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘_Vraiment!_ I shouldn’t have thought it!’ rejoined the other,\n",
      "incredulously.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had felt the slight form in my clasp shiver under these words, as if\n",
      "it had been struck, and I could bear it no longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Ange!’ I exclaimed vehemently, ‘you _must_ come home! this is no place\n",
      "for you! and you will catch your death of cold if you remain here any\n",
      "longer. I _insist_ upon your returning with me!’\n",
      "\n",
      "But there was no answer to my appeal, only the form I held seemed to\n",
      "sink lower and lower, until I could support it no longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Ange! Ange!’ I went on in terror, ‘try and hold yourself up, or I must\n",
      "call for assistance. I cannot carry you. Oh, darling! make one effort\n",
      "and let me get you home!’\n",
      "\n",
      "Still she sunk down—down—heavier each moment in my arms.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Mr. Charteris!’ I screamed in my alarm; ‘Mr. Charteris! Come here! Come\n",
      "at once—Ange is dying!’\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a sudden commotion in the billiard-room as my voice reached\n",
      "its occupants—a few exclamations of surprise—a cessation of sound—and\n",
      "then Cave Charteris came flying through the open window to my aid.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Hold her up!’ I panted; ‘I have no strength left! She escaped from us\n",
      "in her delirium, and I must have her carried home at once.’\n",
      "\n",
      "He seized the little figure from me and laid the head against his arm.\n",
      "The light from the billiard-room streamed over her pallid face: her\n",
      "violet eyes were closed and sunken: there was a grey shade about the\n",
      "mouth that was not to be mistaken.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Ange! Ange! speak to me!’ I cried, in my anguish and dismay.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Ange! _petite_ Ange! say you forgive me,’ chimed in the deeper tones of\n",
      "Cave Charteris’s voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that sound she opened her eyes, very, very slowly, as if the action\n",
      "gave her pain, and fixed them upon his. I saw the words, ‘I _forgive_,’\n",
      "tremble upon the quivering lips, which closed again and then fell open\n",
      "as her spirit passed away upon the wings of Night!\n",
      "\n",
      "                  *       *       *       *       *\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel that no description I can append to this simple recital can\n",
      "increase its pathos. Ange died—just as I have told you—and I never\n",
      "looked upon the face of Cave Charteris after that night. I never wish to\n",
      "look upon it. He ranks in my memory as one of the worst men I ever met.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lovett arrived home on the next day, with the doctor in his train,\n",
      "when _petite_ Ange was lying stretched and still upon her bed, with her\n",
      "waxen hands filled with the autumn flowers the poor of St. Pucelle had\n",
      "placed in them. Her father’s grief was naturally very violent—such\n",
      "saintly mourners usually mourn noisily. Yet he had not considered his\n",
      "child’s illness of sufficient importance to oblige him to give up a\n",
      "dinner at Rille, which he had been pledged to attend on the previous\n",
      "day.\n",
      "\n",
      "I almost wondered, as I watched him bury her in the little strip of\n",
      "ground appropriated to those of her faith, in the Abbé Morteville’s\n",
      "cemetery, that he did not fall headlong on the coffin and denounce\n",
      "himself as Ange’s murderer. But no such idea ever entered his venerable\n",
      "head. He lived for several years afterwards, to talk of virtue and\n",
      "practice vice, and when he died, his creditors howled like hungry wolves\n",
      "above his grave, and had to recoup themselves by abusing him for the\n",
      "rest of their lives. Some few got their money—those to whom I had\n",
      "promised it in the courtyard—but their demands were but as a drop in the\n",
      "ocean. Mr. Warrington’s advent in St. Pucelle was a terrible blow to Mr.\n",
      "Lovett, especially when his legal research on my behalf resulted in the\n",
      "discovery that a large portion of my little patrimony had been wasted or\n",
      "spent. But I would not let him prosecute my guardian, for Tessie’s sake.\n",
      "I felt that she had sorrows enough to bear, poor girl, without this open\n",
      "disgrace being added to them. By the time that Mr. Lovett died, my\n",
      "Armand’s term of probation in Algiers was ended, and he had got his own\n",
      "again, so I made Tessie come and live with us.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was a happy period. It was so delightful to watch the roses return\n",
      "to her cheeks, and the roundness to her form, and to feel that the\n",
      "saddest part of her life was over, and she was free to choose her future\n",
      "destiny. But we did not keep her with us long. In Paris that was hardly\n",
      "to be expected! Every one prophesied she would marry a foreigner, yet\n",
      "she married——\n",
      "\n",
      "Stay! Armand and I are going over next week to England, to spend a whole\n",
      "month in Norwood, with my dear old friend Mrs. Sandilands, to whom I am\n",
      "very anxious to introduce my husband and my son, Godefroi de\n",
      "Nesselrode—who is already seven years old.\n",
      "\n",
      "And Charlie, dear old boy! is anticipating our arrival as if he were\n",
      "still my mother’s ‘blue-eyed baby’ of twenty-two, instead of a sober\n",
      "citizen of thirty, because he wants me, not to be introduced to, but to\n",
      "renew my acquaintance with, _his wife_—Mrs. Sandilands Number Two—my\n",
      "dear friend Tessie!\n",
      "\n",
      "It all came about as naturally as possible, although it sounds so\n",
      "romantic, for Charlie came to stay with us in Paris, and popped the\n",
      "question to her there, without even asking my advice upon the subject,\n",
      "and took her home with him to be his mother’s eldest daughter!\n",
      "\n",
      "                  *       *       *       *       *\n",
      "\n",
      "So they all lived happy ever afterwards. Yes, that is true—strictly and\n",
      "literally true—because they were not such fools as to expect, or wish\n",
      "for, unalloyed happiness in this world of shadow. They had been hungry,\n",
      "and they were filled—they had been naked, and they were clothed—they had\n",
      "suffered, sometimes very acutely—and they were loved and looked after,\n",
      "and guarded by good and true men, and would have been ingrates as well\n",
      "as fools, not to recognise how much more fortunate they were than many\n",
      "of their fellows.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there is one dark passage in Tessie’s life and mine which we shall\n",
      "never forget—the night that Ange’s spirit spread its wings and flew away\n",
      "from us. Sometimes I wonder, when Armand is more than usually tender to\n",
      "me, or little Godefroi more than usually good, if _she_ is hovering\n",
      "round us who are so happy, and rejoices because we rejoice. Or does she\n",
      "stand by Cave Charteris’s side, for the sake of the love she bore him,\n",
      "to urge him on to better thoughts and a higher career? Or is she\n",
      "wandering through the Elysian fields with the old father whom she\n",
      "believed in so faithfully, until his blazoned disgrace snapped her\n",
      "tender heartstrings!\n",
      "\n",
      "Who can tell me? No parson, no priest, no book! Nothing but the great\n",

      "all our sorrows: Death!\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us thank God that amidst the troubles He ordained for this earthly\n",

    "newscon = \"\"\" China plans to accelerate the creation of a development bank and set up an international platform for energy cooperation, Chinese President Xi Jinping announced Monday at a summit that represents an emerging challenge to U.S. global leadership with the participation of Russia and India.\n",
    "\n",
    "Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi were among the leaders meeting in Tianjin, in northern China, for the annual summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. The security forum was originally seen as a foil to U.S. influence in Central Asia and has grown in size and influence over the years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Xi is attempting to expand the scope of the SCO. He announced initial plans for a development bank run by the organization, introduced a cooperation platform for green and energy industries and pledged $1.4 billion in loans over the next three years to the organization’s members.\n",
    "\n",
    "Xi also said he was opening the way for SCO member states to use China’s BeiDou satellite system, an alternative to the GPS system controlled by the U.S.\n",
    "\n",
    "Putin expressed support for Xi’s initiatives, saying he believes the SCO “could take on the leading role in efforts to form a more just and equal system of global governance in the world.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Laos joined the SCO as a partner, a designation short of full membership, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told reporters. The combined group of members and partners has reached 27, representing countries in Central and Southeast Asia, along with China, India, Russia, Iran and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "China on message\n",
    "Xi stressed countries should reject Cold War thinking, rival power blocs and bullying and instead protect the U.N.-centered international system. He called for a world order with multiple power centers and a more just and balanced global governance system.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The shadows of Cold War mentality, bullying, are not dissipating, and there are new challenges that are increasing, not diminishing,” said Xi, who has consistently spoken against what he calls a Cold War mentality, which is his way of referring to the tough approach to China by the U.S.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The world has entered a new period of tumultuous change and global governance has arrived at a new crossroads,″ he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alfred Wu, a professor at the National University of Singapore’s Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, explained that Xi is seeking “to provide an alternate world order, because the U.S.-led world order is very much in decline.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Putin echoed those themes in his own address and expressed support for Xi’s proposal “to create a new, more effective and functional system of global governance.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Founded in 2001, the SCO now includes Russia, Belarus, China, India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Afghanistan and Mongolia are observer states, and 14 other countries, including several from the Middle East, serve as “dialogue partners.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The summit comes days ahead of a military parade in Beijing marking the 80th anniversary of Japan’s World War II surrender.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regional relationships\n",
    "On Sunday, Xi met with Modi and the two leaders vowed to resolve differences surrounding a border dispute, which led to a freeze in relations in 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "Putin arrived for the summit Sunday and will attend the parade Wednesday. Modi will not stay for the parade.\n",
    "\n",
    "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who did not attend the SCO summit, will be present for the military parade, along with the leader of Myanmar’s military government, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Putin spoke to Xi on Sunday, ahead of the bilateral talks the two were scheduled to hold Tuesday. He updated the Chinese leader on the Russia-U.S. talks on the Ukraine war which were held in Alaska last month.\n",
    "\n",
    "Development policy has been a large part of the messaging in recent days. Putin, in an interview released Saturday by China’s news agency Xinhua, said Russia and China were jointly “against discriminatory sanctions” that hurt the socioeconomic development of the world at large.\n",
    "\n",
    "Russia, alongside its Chinese partners, supports the reform of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "“It is essential to end the use of finance as an instrument of neocolonialism, which runs counter to the interests of the global majority,” Putin said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Security is still key\n",
    "While China is eager for the SCO to take a larger role on the global stage, it remains to be seen how effective the organization can be. Its focus in the past has been on propping up the security initiatives of its member states. China said it is effective in combating terrorism, separatism and extremism.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those threats are what Beijing cited after it swept more than 1 million Uyghurs, Kazakhs and members of other largely Muslim minorities into camps, prisons, and other detention facilities in 2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Their anti-terrorism exercises are more about countering threats to authoritarian regimes rather than countering terrorism in its own right,” said Derek Grossman, a professor of international relations at the University of Southern California.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if the SCO summit’s reach and influence is ultimately limited, one thing is clear, he said: “China is on a diplomatic uptick and the U.S. is self destructing.”\n",

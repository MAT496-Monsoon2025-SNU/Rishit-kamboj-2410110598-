The situation in China mirrors this global trend, as the prevalence of mental disorders has risen steadily over the past 30 years (4). Mental health challenges in China’s ethnic minority regions, in particular, warrant special attention due to their unique socio-cultural contexts. For instance, research has shown that psychological abuse and neglect are more prevalent among girls in ethnic minority regions than in Han regions, contributing to long-term negative mental health outcomes (5).

In contrast, a ﬁxed mindset assumes that traits like intelligence, personality, and even moral values are ﬁxed and unchangeable (10). Existing research highlights that a growth mindset can mitigate mental health problems, whereas a ﬁxed mindset is linked to a greater risk of such issues (11, 12).

A growth mindset encourages healthy and adaptive responses to anxiety, frustration, and disappointment, fostering greater resilience and persistence in the face of challenges (18). This resilience stems from the use of effort-based strategies when pursuing goals (19). Individuals with a growth mindset are often less stressed and report fewer psychological symptoms.

This is particularly relevant when exploring its role in adolescent mental health. A meta-analysis found that adolescents with stronger ﬁxed mindsets exhibited more emotional and behavioral problems, an association consistent across variables such as gender, age, and methodological factors (22). Furthermore, longitudinal research revealed that a stronger ﬁxed mindset in early adolescence predicted more severe mental health problems (both internalizing and externalizing) over a six-month period (24).

Meaning in life refers to an individual’s perception of purpose, mission, and overarching goals in life (25). In this model, two primary dimensions (i.e., presence of meaning, search for meaning) were addressed. The presence of meaning refers to having clear life goals and direction. Individuals with a growth mindset are often more inclined to pursue personal growth and realize their potential, contributing to a heightened sense of purpose. This sense of purpose further contributes to their presence of meaning. This process also aligns closely with the second dimension of meaning in life (i.e., search for meaning). With a growth-oriented mindset, individuals continuously adjust their understanding of meaning and explore new direction and values, which ultimately enrich their lives.'),\n",

These patterns reﬂect regional disparities in educational access and provide valuable context for understanding the ﬁndings. It is worth noting that the psychological symptoms were not inﬂuenced by their ethnic status while differences were observed in growth mindset and meaning of life based on minority status. This may be attributed to the shared school environment, which provides a relatively uniform context for psychological experiences, while belief systems are more strongly shaped by cultural and socioeconomic status. Building on this insight, future research should further explore the potential impact of ethnicity on psychological outcomes within this group.\\n\\n4.1 The effect of growth mindset on psychological symptoms'),\n",

Longitudinal analysis, on the other hand, allows for a deeper understanding of how constructs such as growth mindset inﬂuence psychological symptoms across temporal sequences. In this study, the more pronounced effects in the longitudinal model suggest that the inﬂuence of a growth mindset on psychological symptoms may strengthen over time, as adolescents consistently internalize its positive impact. The mediating role of meaning in life further emphasizes this temporal sequence, suggesting that sustained engagement with a growth mindset can foster a deeper and more enduring sense of life purpose, which in turn reduces psychological distress (43, 44). This ﬁnding underscores the dynamic nature of psychological processes and aligns with theories suggesting that positive cognitive frameworks require time to fully manifest their beneﬁts.'),\n",

       "**Key ideas to focus on when pursuing research in psychology (based on the article):**\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Causality vs. Correlation**  \n",
       "   - The study demonstrates that while a longitudinal design can establish temporal order, it cannot definitively prove that growth mindset *causes* changes in mental health.  \n",
       "   - Future work should therefore employ **randomized controlled designs** or **targeted interventions** to strengthen causal claims.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Growth Mindset as a Variable of Interest**  \n",
       "   - Growth mindset is central to the model; it is linked to psychological symptoms through mediating mechanisms.  \n",
       "   - Researchers should consider how to **measure, manipulate, and intervene** on growth mindset in experimental settings.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Mediation by Meaning in Life**  \n",
       "   - The article highlights **meaning in life** as a key mediator between growth mindset and psychological symptoms.  \n",
       "   - Investigating the pathways and mechanisms of this mediation (e.g., how meaning is constructed, maintained, or disrupted) is essential.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Cultural and Contextual Adaptation**  \n",
       "   - The sample came from ethnic regions of China, underscoring the need for **culturally adapted tools** to improve both generalizability and relevance.  \n",
       "   - Researchers should develop or validate instruments that reflect local cultural nuances.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Developmental (Age) Considerations**  \n",
       "   - Differences in average age across samples suggested developmental stages may influence the relationships studied.  \n",
       "   - Future research should **explore age‑specific mechanisms** to design interventions that are developmentally appropriate.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Generalizability and Relevance**  \n",
       "   - The authors note that findings are consistent across mediation paths but that cultural and age factors may moderate effects.  \n",
       "   - Emphasizing **external validity** (e.g., diverse samples, cross‑cultural replication) will strengthen the field.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. **Methodological Rigor**  \n",
       "   - The limitations point to the importance of **experimental manipulation** and **random assignment** to control for confounding variables.  \n",
       "   - Researchers should plan studies that can isolate the effect of growth mindset from other influences.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Take‑away for a psychology researcher:**  \n",
       "Focus on designing experiments that manipulate growth mindset, measure meaning in life, and assess mental health outcomes across culturally diverse and age‑specific populations. Such work will help clarify causal mechanisms, improve intervention relevance, and enhance the field’s overall robustness."

A phenomenon that has cropped up is 'doom scrolling' or habitually reading negative news or upsetting information on online platforms, especially during crises (Muzaffar, et. al., 2019; McGowan, 2020). While staying up-to-date is critical, repeated exposure to bad news can result in elevated levels of anxiety, fatigue, and lower levels of psychological resilience (Price et al., 2022). Students studying the media may also be most at risk because they spend most of their academic and professional lives immersed in online material. Students of media studies in Karachi, the media capital of Pakistan, are not only heavy consumers, but also producers and curators, of digital content.

Institutions must also provide accessible mental health support and promote healthier screen habits through awareness campaigns. Social media platforms should introduce usage alerts and reduce algorithmic exposure to negative content. Additionally, students should be encouraged to engage in offline activities, and future research should focus on sustainable coping strategies tailored to the needs of digital-native youth.\\n\\n367\\n\\nAnnals of Human and Social Sciences (AHSS)\\n\\nApril-June, 2025 Vol 6, Issue 2\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nBauer, R., & Singh, D.

For a 9‑year‑old, it’s best to focus on fun, learning, and staying connected with family, while keeping scary news to a minimum. If you ever feel upset after seeing something online, tell a trusted adult—there’s always help and a chance to feel better."
